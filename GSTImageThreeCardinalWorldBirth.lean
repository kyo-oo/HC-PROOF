# GST Image 3 — original self-expanding arbitrary-cardinal world births
# preserve the ORIGINAL physical Navigation and source-sensitive GST F

The user's image 3 requires the original infinitely growing cosmos,
arbitrary-cardinal simultaneous inputs, physical Navigation constant,
native CM curvature and N-cohomology together.

This file uses the OWNER'S preexisting:
  GSTGraphV2SelfExpandingCosmology.SelfExpandingCosmos
  GSTGraphV2SelfExpandingCosmology.generated_induction
with its ORIGINAL three Sector roots and arbitrary-arity certified
Birth src target. No finite replacement graph is used.

The new image-3 physical Navigation condition propagates across all
generated worlds IF AND ONLY IF the provided birth certificate actually
preserves it along the generating closure. No numeric conjecture or
unknown Chow birth is asserted automatically.

The results are about ORIGINAL GST navigation and wave cycles, NOT
rational Hodge algebraicity of arbitrary X.
