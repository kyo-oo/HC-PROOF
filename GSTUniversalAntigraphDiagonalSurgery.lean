# GST universal antiholomorphic graph / diagonal integer surgery

For EVERY n>=1, on the ACTUAL smooth projective variety
X_n = P^n(C) x P^n(C), let A,B be factor hyperplane classes.

The graph Γ_c of complex conjugation c:P^n->P^n has middle integral
Poincare-dual polynomial
  sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^(n-j) A^(n-j) B^j.
It is the GST self-product universal primitive polynomial with
the variables SWAPPED: universalPrimitive B A n.

The holomorphic diagonal Δ has class
  sum_{j=0}^n A^(n-j) B^j.

Thus their sum has EXACTLY the positive even-parity monomials:
  [Γ_c]+[Δ] =
     2 sum_{0<=j<=n, Even(n-j)} A^(n-j) B^j.

Every monomial is represented by the holomorphic product of two
linear subspaces P^j x P^(n-j). Hence this identity produces an
actual integral-homology-preserving surgery
  Γ_c + Δ --> 2 sum_{Even(n-j)} (P^j x P^(n-j)).
All output components are Kähler calibrated; input Γ_c is
Lagrangian and NOT calibrated.

Lean proves the universal coefficient identity in ANY commutative
ring and confirms the parity-positive normal form. The analytical
interpretation uses genuine projective graph, diagonal and linear
subspace fundamental classes, and standard geometry; this file
does NOT assert every Hodge class on an arbitrary X is algebraic.

/-! ## Integral complementary-parity splitting of the whole diagonal

The earlier theorem exhibited one effective half of the graph+diagonal.
The upgraded result constructs BOTH complementary integral effective
packets and proves the exact unsigned decomposition of twice
the holomorphic diagonal, for every n and every commutative ring.
This strengthens the all-n geometric surgery to a complete parity
resolution without ever dividing by two in integer homology.

/-! ## Arbitrary finite cellular correspondences: a larger GST law

The original projective-space index {0,...,n} is unnecessary. In a
smooth projective variety with a unimodular effective cellular
Kunneth decomposition of its diagonal and an anti-holomorphic
involution acting on each even degree by parity, EACH diagonal
basis tensor can be treated as one index below.

This proves the full integer positive/negative parity resolution
for *any* finite basis (e.g. Schubert/opposite-Schubert
decompositions on split projective flag varieties when the
correspondence inputs are verified). The result is an exact
coefficient theorem, not a claim that every arbitrary X has
such an effective basis or antiholomorphic involution.

/-! ## Signed arbitrary-degree graph surgery beyond antiholomorphic isometries

Let f : ℙⁿ → ℙⁿ be ANY smooth self-map with f*hyperplane = k·hyperplane,
k : ℤ. The PD of its oriented graph has integral coefficients
k^(n-j) in the product cellular basis. This extends the k=-1
antigraph theorem to ALL topological degrees, including nonlinear
antiholomorphic maps with k=-r for arbitrary r≥1.

The following *integer* shift constructs an effective holomorphic
replacement in precisely the same integral homology class. It is not a
universal operation on arbitrary X: the proof uses the effective
cellular basis of ℙⁿ × ℙⁿ.
