# GST GRAPH V2 — RECURSIVE STATE CAUSALITY

`GSTGraphV2SelfExpandingCosmology` lets events generate new worlds.  The next
layer lets mathematical objects move inside and between those worlds.

A packed state remembers both its world and its world-specific internal state.
Primitive steps are either local events inside one world or transports between
two worlds.  Their transitive closure therefore describes an object whose
ambient geometry may itself change while the object evolves.

This is the intended setting for constructions such as

scheme point → cycle → cycle class → Hodge state,

where the intermediate objects do not live in one fixed carrier.
