# GENERAL SPACE THEORY — SCHEME STALK FAMILY

A scheme is not reduced to coordinates in GST.  Its underlying topological
carrier is one General-Space realization, while its local rings form a genuine
point-dependent family above that carrier.

This is the local algebra layer needed by the Hodge principal-cut frontier:
Krull dimension is observed directly on the actual scheme stalk fiber.
