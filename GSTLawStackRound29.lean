# GST BOUNDARY BREACH — ROUND 29 LEAN FACE (**DRAFT-NOT-COMPILED**, per SKILL §13)

**STATUS: DRAFT-NOT-COMPILED.** Updated 2026-10-28 at the owner's request;
compilation is intentionally left to the owner. An unverified Lean file is
TEXT, NOT PROOF — it is never claimed as machine-checked, and "it compiles"
is never asserted. The verification ladder for this content is (1) the
adversarially-audited LaTeX derivation
`research/derivations/GST_boundary_breach_round29_2026_11_01.tex`
(0 errors, tectonic), (2) the committed exact-arithmetic certificate
(`research/experiments/boundary_breach_checks.py` — 154 checks, EXIT 0,
deterministic double-run byte-identical; the audit's different-route
recompute `hodge-campaign/audits/audit29_selfaudit_recompute.py` — 10
probes, EXIT 0), and (3) THIS draft, whose value is that it exposes the
logical shape the natural language hides.

**Toolchain steps for an equipped environment** (the repo's own):
`lean-toolchain` is `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0-rc2` with mathlib
`v4.33.0-rc2`; this module is now registered in `GSTOpenAISourceUpgrade`.

## What is in this file (PART F of the law stack)

PART F-1 — the |C_4|-torsion law, kernel-level: the cyclic-norm identity
`cycloid_sub_one` ((1+γ+γ²+γ³)∘(γ−1) = γ⁴−1 = 0 — the identity underlying
both the H¹ and the H² four-torsion structure), and the doubling witness
`two_smul_of_norm_sq` (the R1-style 2-torsion witness on a γ² = −1 module:
2v = −(γ−1)((1+γ)v)).

PART F-2 — actual exact-sequence maps and equations, with the
16-bound as the theorem `uniform_kill_of_five_term` (the proof's
arithmetic: 4·(mixed image) = 0 by the |C_4| law; 4c then lies in the
inflation image, itself 4-torsion; 16c = 0), the rational denominator
bound. The five-term cohomology specialization remains an explicit input;
the group-theoretic theorem now proves 16 • c = 0 instead of `True`.

PART F-3 — the honest-invariant dichotomy, kernel-level conditional: the
concentration criterion record (`ConcentrationCriterion`): the mixed-cell
map's injectivity on the post-strip sector given
zero inflation and exactness — the criterion that replaces Round 28's
A^Γ = A idealization (boundary (b)). No field asserts injectivity itself.

PART F-4 — the 2×2 no-go, kernel-level on the explicit quaternion order:
WR² = 1, WI² = −1, WR·WI = WK, WI·WR = −WK (all kernel-provable on the
explicit matrices), and the deck-action mismatch as the labeled statement
(`no_algebra_hom_of_cont`): the computed witness
(CONT W_I)² = +I ≠ −I: the 2×2 content envelope cannot carry the committed
deck — the first computed obstruction datum of the nonabelian boundary (a).

PART F-5 — the equivariant envelope, as the hypothesis-record
(`EquivariantEnvelope`): the rotation lattice's intertwinement
(γ A' γ⁻¹ = −B', γ B' γ⁻¹ = A') and square-zero span are actual equations.
The dressing multiplication law is derived. The 64×64 exact kernel, trace
cross-check
tr(Φ²) = (tr γ²)² = 16, and the complete 4096-cell basis sweep live in the
certificate remain historical receipts, not verification of this revision.

/-- The cyclic-norm identity: for any endomorphism `g` with `g ^ 4 = 1`,
the cyclic norm annihilates the difference: this is the identity underlying
the four-torsion structure of `H^n(C_4; M)` in both degrees (the H^1
relation `im (g - 1) ⊆ ker N` and the H^2 relation `im N ⊆ ker (g - 1)`). -/

/-- **The uniform kill's arithmetic (Round 29's T1).** Given the five-term
exactness and the |C_4|-torsion law (both standard, both gated instance-wise
in the certificate: exponents 2, 4, 4 on the content/glue/trivial modules),
every post-strip two-cell class `c` dies at scale 16:
`4 • (mix c) = 0` (the law) ⟹ `mix (4 • c) = 0` (linearity) ⟹
`4 • c ∈ im(infl)` (exactness) ⟹ `4 • (4 • c) = 0` (the law again) ⟹
`16 • c = 0`. This conclusion applies to every instance of the displayed
data. Geometric existence of such an instance on a general input, and its
comparison with the descent chain, are separate obligations. -/

/-- **The deck-action mismatch (the 2×2 no-go), the labeled statement.**
The deck's coordinate action is NOT an algebra homomorphism of the
quaternion content order: `CONT (W_I) = W_R` and `W_R ^ 2 = +1` while the
algebra relation demands the image of `W_I ^ 2 = -1` be `-1`. The
certificate gates the witness on the explicit matrices (check 0134) and
the non-innerness (every unit squares to ±1, so every inner automorphism
has order ≤ 2 < 4, check 0135): the 2×2 content envelope cannot carry the
committed deck; the equivariant realization must live at the `H_z` level
(PART F-5). The identities `WR_sq`, `WI_sq`, `WR_WI`, `WI_WR` above are
the kernel content; the full homomorphism-structure statement is the
equipped environment's instantiation target. -/

`γ A' γ⁻¹ = -B'`, `γ B' γ⁻¹ = A'` for all 24 basis candidates, and the
