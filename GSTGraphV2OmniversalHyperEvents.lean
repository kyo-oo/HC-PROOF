# GST GRAPH V2 — OMNIVERSAL HIGHER-ARITY EVENT CLOSURE

Ordinary directed edges are not enough for geometry.  Cup products,
intersections, fiber products, tensor operations, finite linear synthesis, and
many correspondence constructions consume several inputs simultaneously.

This file therefore extends the carrier-agnostic three-sector graph by typed
higher-arity rules.  The arity itself is an arbitrary type: no finite bound,
coordinate dimension, or numerical shape is built into the ontology.

A generated state may arise from a seed, from one ordinary causal event, or
from a higher-arity event whose every premise has already been generated.
This is the closure object intended for number theory, manifold geometry,
scheme geometry, Hodge constructions, and future cosmological realizations.
