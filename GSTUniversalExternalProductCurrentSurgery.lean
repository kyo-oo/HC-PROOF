# GST universal external-product geometric surgery: exact defect transport

Original target: produce, for EVERY smooth projective complex X and
EVERY primitive rational Hodge class, an integral homology preserving
replacement current with absolute Kähler calibration defect tending to 0.

On ANY smooth projective X of any dimension, let S be a closed integral
2q-current. On P¹xP¹ there is the genuine integral homology relation
    [anti-holomorphic graph Γ]+[holomorphic diagonal Δ]
      = 2 [holomorphic ruling fiber F].

External product with S makes an ACTUAL closed integral boundary surgery
on XxP¹xP¹, for every X and any integral current S:
   S x (Γ+Δ) --> 2 (S x F).

With product Kähler metric, the full geometric mass/period identities
for integer rectifiable products are:
   Mass(S x (Γ+Δ)) = 4 Mass(S),
   Period(S x (Γ+Δ)) = 2 Period(S);
   Mass(2 S x F) = 2 Mass(S),
   Period(2 S x F) = 2 Period(S).
The base Γ and Δ have disjoint sheets in 2-dimensional measure.
These identities show exact lowering of mass by 2 Mass(S).

CRITICAL: The OUTPUT defect is 2 * Defect(S), hence vanishes
ONLY IF S already was calibrated. This explicitly tests and REJECTS
a possible inference that universal product-based GST surgery
eliminates arbitrary primitive Hodge defects on X.

Lean verifies the exact universal mass/period arithmetic and the
base integer homology identity, not the analytic external-product
theorems of geometric measure theory. No all-X Hodge assertion occurs.

/-! ## Sharp tensor calibration rigidity for every positive holomorphic factor

The old packet was a special case with factor Kähler volume 2.
For ANY positive calibrated product factor of volume v>0,
the remaining primitive defect is exactly v·D(S).
Neither tensor stabilization nor repeating factor surgeries can
turn a noncalibrated primitive carrier into a calibrated current.
This is a quantitative arithmetic identity; its geometric
application assumes the standard mass/period multiplicativity
of external products, not an unverified universal GST functor.

/-! ## Rigidity even for noncalibrated auxiliary tensor factors

A calibrated tensor factor was not essential to the nonvanishing
argument. If both Kähler periods are positive, and the factor obeys
the calibration inequality, a zero tensor defect forces BOTH
factors to be individually calibrated. This is an exact numerical
obstruction to all product-only primitive-defect elimination. -/
