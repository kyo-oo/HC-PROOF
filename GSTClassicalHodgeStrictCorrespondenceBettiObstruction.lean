# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — STRICT CORRESPONDENCE BETTI TRANSFER OBSTRUCTION

The intrinsic analytic span of a strict scheme-bi-finite correspondence gives
canonical pullbacks

  l^*, r^* : H^n(X,Q) -> H^n(C_an,Q)

on the COMPLETE rational singular cohomology carrier.  Turning this span into
a single-valued correspondence operator means solving

  r^*(beta) = l^*(alpha)

for beta, for every alpha.  This file isolates that problem exactly as one
quotient-valued linear obstruction.

No arbitrary extension is chosen.  No Hodge algebraicity is assumed.  The
obstruction vanishes on a class precisely when the strict correspondence
relation has a target for that class; it vanishes identically precisely when
the relation is total.  If r^* is injective, the target is automatically
unique, hence the geometric relation becomes a canonical full-Betti operator.

This is the precise algebraic-topology interface required by the final
push-pull construction.
