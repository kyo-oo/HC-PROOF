# GST N-HOMOLOGY SURGERY: integer geometric replacement on P1 x P1

Original all-X target is an integral homology-preserving replacement of
arbitrary primitive Hodge currents by Kähler calibrated ones.

The previous GST N-cohomology is a rational coordinate module and lacks
a geometric boundary operator. This module adds an integer boundary move
in the actual P1 x P1 geometric test, with:
  A = antiholomorphic antipodal graph, class B-A, area 2, period 0;
  Y = holomorphic diagonal,          class A+B, area 2, period 2;
  F = holomorphic ruling fiber,      class B,   area 1, period 1.
The genuine projective homology relation is [A]+[Y]=2[F].
Its boundary is an integer three-current in P1 x P1, by the
integral cycle homology relation; NO explicit 3-current is
built in Lean here.

Replacing A+Y by 2F preserves integral homology and lowers the
ABSOLUTE calibration defect from 2 to 0. The same arithmetic
works for ANY nonnegative integer combination in which enough
diagonal sheets are present to replace all negative-angle sheets.

This is a concrete geometry-specific GST N-channel boundary surgery,
not a universal all-X Hodge solver. Its verification makes the real
global remaining obligation clear: manufacture geometrically certified
homology relations allowing this surgery for arbitrary primitive
Hodge carriers on arbitrary X.

/-! ## Exact classification of the integer geometric surgery orbit

The original result constructed one good surgery.  The upgraded law is
COMPLETE in this genuine P¹×P¹ three-carrier model: two integer geometric
packets have equal full integral homology if and only if their difference
is an integer multiple of the graph+diagonal-to-rulings boundary relation.

For positive packets, the EXISTENCE of any positive calibrated packet in
a given exact homology class is equivalent to the sharp inequality
anti <= diagonal.  This is an actual integer-effective cone criterion
for this geometric configuration, with no rational saturation shortcut.

be a GLOBAL MASS MINIMIZER against EVERY signed integer packet in
the same full H₂ class, not just those accessible by a chosen
monotone surgery or with nonnegative coordinates.
