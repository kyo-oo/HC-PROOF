# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — REDUCED / INTEGRAL POINT CLOSURE

`pointClosureScheme V x` was deliberately defined as the subscheme associated
to the vanishing ideal of the closed set `closure {x}`.  Mathlib's vanishing
ideal gives the reduced induced scheme structure.  This file exposes that fact
in the exact form needed by the local principal-cut dimension argument.

On every affine chart `U`, the vanishing ideal is a radical ring ideal.  Hence
`Gamma(U) / I(U)` is reduced.  The canonical subscheme cover consists exactly
of the spectra of those quotient rings, so the whole point-closure scheme is
reduced.  The closure is already proved irreducible; reduced + irreducible is
therefore integral.  In particular every point-closure stalk is a domain.

No Hodge data, cycle-class map, or nonvanishing assumption occurs here.
