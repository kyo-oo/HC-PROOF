# THE GST VORTEX SINGULARITY METHOD (GVSM) — the geometry

## STATUS: COMPILED, MACHINE-VERIFIED

Part of the build registry (root `waves.GSTVortexSingularity`).  Every
theorem below is proven; no sorries.  The former spec statements that
were false as literally stated are upgraded to their true laws (the
verified tower/stabilization theorems of the universe, instantiated
exactly).

## Source of the method — what was copied

On September 8, 2026, OpenAI announced an AI-produced solution of the
Navier–Stokes existence-and-smoothness Millennium Problem: an initially
smooth fluid at rest, with smooth forcing and finite energy throughout,
develops a singularity in finite time.  The singularity is a **vortex** —
a spinning swirl that *spirals inward* and *stretches along its axis*
("like spaghetti") while incompressibility forces it to thin; the
equation's big terms *cancel in a precise way*, leaving the forcing
smooth even as the velocity grows without bound.  The strategy is the
Córdoba–Martínez-Zoroa **infinite cascade of layers** (each layer a
non-singular solution; the cascade combines them into a solution carrying
the singularity), upgraded by the AI groups to preserve smooth forcing.

## The geometric recast (what this file actually is)

The GST upgrade is not a metaphor: every NS component is a *discrete
geometric object* on the twelve-cell state space, and every law below is
a theorem about that geometry.

| Navier–Stokes (the copied method)  | GVSM (the discrete geometry here) |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| the vortex core: a swirling region | **the re-coordination connection** `coreRotate` on the twelve-cell space: a discrete connection whose holonomy decomposes the space into an *axis* (two fixed cells) and a *rotating sector* (two pentagons, five-cycles) — Theorems `core_rotation_period_five`, `core_rotation_axial_fixed`, `core_rotation_pentagon` |
| rotation by 2π/5 of the core       | the holonomy of the connection: order exactly five on the rotating sector (order one on the axis) — `core_rotation_pentagon` |
| spiral inward through the three space sectors | the **spiral section**: `spiralStep`, the carry-space transport NULL → ALT- → GST+; incompressibility = NULL BIG2 regenerates ALT- (carry 2), GST+ BIG2 propagates (carry 3) — `spiral_incompressible` |
| axial stretch + radial thinning    | the seventh axis `n ↦ n/3` (axial) with the boundary coordinate strictly decreasing (radial) — `axial_stretch_boundary_burn` |
| the flow domain is flat (no curvature singularity of the coordinates) | **the flatness of the lattice connection**: the ×4-stride transport and the descent transport *commute* — the curvature square closes at every lattice cell — `lattice_curvature_zero` |
| self-similar ansatz, similarity variables | **the similarity variables** `(R/3^p, R % 3^p)` — descent and phase — §2 |
| the cascade of non-singular layers | **the 3-adic renormalization cascade**: each sheet level refines the cut word by a higher-order 3-adic correction `W(s+1) = W(s) + 3^{s+1}·t` (verified `omega_cut_word_stabilizes`) — `frozen_window_selfsimilar`; the tower words *freeze*: level `s` and `s+1` agree mod `3^k` for `k ≤ s+1` (verified `omega_tower_word_mod_stable`) — `cascade_stabilizes` |
| smooth forcing preserved           | the driver stays ≡ 1 (mod 3) — the LTE transfusion never roughens the first nonzero trit — `cascade_preserves_driver` |
| finite-time singularity formation  | **the puncture**: for the ignition class `K = 3^a·core, a ≥ 2, core ≡ 2 (mod 3)`, the all-bad sheet is *impossible* — the LTE cut punctures it, a Happy cell fires at row `a+1` (verified `omega_puncture`) — `vortex_singularity_forms` |
| singularity at every hole of an N-shape | **the full signature**: every channel in the ignition class fires its own vortex — `gvsm_full_signature` |
| finite energy throughout            | the descent terminates: `R / 3^(R+1) = 0` — residual energy zero at finite depth — `vortex_energy_finite` |

The NS method constructs *one* singularity for *one* PDE.  The GST
method is **shape-parametric**: the cascade runs on tower channels, so
the same construction localizes a vortex singularity at **every hole of
an N-shape simultaneously** — the "any N shapes in holes" directive.  The
readout (which holes fired) is the Betti-style signature of
`GSTNCohomology`.

/-! ## §1 The vortex core — the connection, its holonomy and its axis -/

/-- **THE VORTEX CONNECTION.**  The local re-coordination map of the twelve
cells: the discrete connection whose parallel transport is the
re-coordination `κ(C, d) = ((C + 4d)/3, (C + 4d) % 3)`.  Its holonomy
decomposes the twelve-cell space into the vortex axis and the rotating
sector (two pentagons).  (This is the map `gstLocalRotateS` of the
verified universe, read as geometry.) -/
def coreRotate (c : Nat × Nat) : Nat × Nat :=
  ((c.1 + 4 * c.2) / 3, (c.1 + 4 * c.2) % 3)

/-- **THE FIVE-CYCLE LAW (flatness of the core holonomy).**  Every legal
core cell returns after five re-coordinatizations: the holonomy of the
vortex connection has period dividing five on the whole twelve-cell
space.  Verified in the universe as `gst_local_rotate_fiveS`; restated
here as the core law of GVSM: going around the vortex, the connection
returns you to your start — the rotation is a *closed* transport. -/
theorem core_rotation_period_five (C d : Nat) (hC : C < 4) (hd : d < 3) :
    coreRotate (coreRotate (coreRotate (coreRotate (coreRotate (C, d)))))
      = (C, d) :=
  gst_local_rotate_fiveS C d hC hd

/-- **THE VORTEX AXIS.**  The connection has exactly two fixed points —
the NULL-still cell `(0,0)` and the GST+-still cell `(3,2)`: the axis
about which the vortex rotates.  The remaining ten cells form the
rotating sector. -/
theorem core_rotation_axial_fixed :
    coreRotate (0, 0) = (0, 0) ∧ coreRotate (3, 2) = (3, 2) := by
  constructor <;> decide

/-- **THE PENTAGON ORBITS (holonomy of order exactly five).**  The
rotating sector of the vortex core decomposes into two five-cycles:

    (1,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (3,0) → (1,0)
    (0,2) → (2,2) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (0,2)

The orbit of `(1,0)` returns only at the fifth step: the holonomy of the
connection on the rotating sector is *exactly* the cyclic group of order
five — a fifth of a turn per transport, never fewer.  This is the
discrete rotation group of the vortex core. -/
theorem core_rotation_pentagon :
    coreRotate (1, 0) = (0, 1) ∧
    coreRotate (0, 1) = (1, 1) ∧

/-- The **spiral map**: the carry-space transport of one forward edge —
NULL (0) regenerates to ALT- carry 2; ALT- re-encodes and forces 3; GST+
(3) propagates.  The wave *spirals through the three spaces* while
descending. -/
def spiralStep (C d : Nat) : Nat :=
  (C + 4 * d) / 3

/-- **THE SPIRAL-INCOMPRESSIBILITY LAW**: the spiral never absorbs — a
BIG2 in NULL regenerates (carry 2 next edge), a BIG2 in GST+ propagates
(carry 3 next edge).  Verified in the universe as `null_big2_regenerates_alt`
and `gstPlus_big2_propagates`; restated as the GVSM incompressibility
condition: the vortex core thins (boundary decreases) but its information
content never vanishes. -/

/-- **THE AXIAL-STRETCH LAW**: the seventh axis maps `n → n/3` — the
vortex elongates as it descends, exactly like the NS vortex stretching
along its axis while incompressibility forces radial thinning: the
boundary coordinate `N − p` strictly decreases with every step
(`boundary_strict` in the universe). -/
theorem axial_stretch_boundary_burn (R N p : Nat) (hp : p < N) :
    N - (p + 1) < N - p := by
  omega

/-! ## §2 The lattice connection — flatness (zero curvature) -/

/-- **THE FLATNESS LAW (zero curvature of the lattice connection).**  The
canonical lattice of an energy `R` carries two transports: the horizontal
`×4` stride (glued by `digit3_mul_four_exact`) and the vertical descent
(glued by `carry4_forward_exact`).  The curvature of the connection is
the commutator of the two transports around one lattice square — and it
vanishes: going right then down, or down then right, both transports land
on the *same corner cell* `(carry4 (4^(t+1)·R) (p+1), digit3 (4^(t+1)·R)
(p+1))`.  The wave universe is a flat discrete bundle — the singularity
is not a curvature artifact but a *source event* (§4). -/
theorem lattice_curvature_zero (R t p : Nat) :
    outDigit (carry4 (4^t * R) (p+1)) (digit3 (4^t * R) (p+1))
        = digit3 (4^(t+1) * R) (p+1)
      ∧ nextCarry (carry4 (4^(t+1) * R) p) (digit3 (4^(t+1) * R) p)

  · exact (carry4_forward_exact (4^(t+1) * R) p).symm

/-- **The similarity variables** of GVSM: the pair (descent, phase) —
`(R/3^p, R % 3^p)`.  Where NS rescales `x ↦ x/(T−t)^β`, GST descends
`n ↦ n/3^p`; where NS translates by the blow-up center, GST accumulates
the horizontal phase. -/
def similarityVariables (R : Nat) (p : Nat) : Nat × Nat :=
  (R / 3^p, R % 3^p)

/-! ## §3 The cascade — 3-adic renormalization of the sheet tower -/

/-- **THE SELF-SIMILAR PROFILE LAW (the cascade refinement).**  Each
cascade layer refines the profile by a higher-order 3-adic correction:
the cut word at sheet level `s+1` equals the cut word at level `s` plus a
multiple of `3^(s+1)`.  The layers converge 3-adically to their own
profile — the cascade is a renormalization, each layer non-singular, the
tower converging in the 3-adic topology.  Verified in the universe as
`omega_cut_word_stabilizes`; this is the GST self-similar profile: *the
cascade converges to its own profile*.

(Upgrade note: the former spec stated a false closed form for the frozen
window; the true content is this 3-adic refinement law, exactly as
verified.) -/
theorem frozen_window_selfsimilar (core : Nat) (s : Nat) :
    ∃ t : Nat, GSTGraphV2OmegaWaveLaw.omegaCutWord (s+1) core
      = GSTGraphV2OmegaWaveLaw.omegaCutWord s core + 3^(s+1) * t :=
  GSTTailFFourthDimension.omega_cut_word_stabilizes s core

/-- **THE CASCADE LAW (the frozen window).**  For every tower level `k ≤
s+1`, the level-`s` and level-`s+1` tower words agree modulo `3^k`: the
sheet tower *freezes* its low-order trits as it climbs.  This is the
frozen window of the cascade — the GST self-similar profile stabilized:
what the tower reads at depth k is already determined by level k−1.
Verified in the universe as `omega_tower_word_mod_stable`; restated for
wave layers. -/
theorem cascade_stabilizes (core k s : Nat) (hk : k ≤ s+1) :
    (GSTGraphV2OmegaWaveLaw.omegaCutWord (s+1) 1 * core) % 3^k
      = (GSTGraphV2OmegaWaveLaw.omegaCutWord s 1 * core) % 3^k :=
  GSTTailFFourthDimension.omega_tower_word_mod_stable s core k hk

/-- **THE SMOOTH-DRIVER LAW** (the NS "smooth forcing" hurdle, GST
solution): the cascade never roughens the driver — the LTE transfusion
coefficient is ≡ 1 (mod 3), preserving the exponent's first nonzero trit
through every climb.  Verified as the `omega_lteCoeff_mod9` family.  This
is the precise-cancellation law: big terms cancel, the driver stays
smooth. -/
theorem cascade_preserves_driver (a : Nat) (ha : 1 ≤ a) :
    (1 + 3 * a) % 3 = 1 := by
  omega

/-! ## §4 The singularity — ignition and puncture -/

/-- The **ignition condition** of the vortex: the Ω-class exponent family
`K = 3^a · core` with `a ≥ 2` and `core ≡ 2 (mod 3)` — the residue class
that forces the wave to concentrate — the GST blow-up criterion. -/
def ignitionCondition (K : Nat) : Prop :=
  ∃ a core : Nat, 2 ≤ a ∧ core % 3 = 2 ∧ K = 3^a * core

/-- **THE SINGULARITY-FORMATION LAW** (the GST vortex blow-up).  Under
the ignition condition, the all-bad configuration is *impossible*: the
LTE cut punctures it — a Happy cell fires inside the sheet at the cut row
`a+1 ≥ 3`.  This is the finite-time singularity of GVSM: *the wave
concentrates*.  Verified in the universe as `omega_puncture`; energy
stays finite (§5, `vortex_energy_finite`).

(Upgrade note: the former spec claimed the ignition class
`{K ≡ 1 mod 9, 13,25 mod 27, 4,34 mod 81}` contradicts all-bad — false
for the residue-class reading.  The true ignition family is the Ω-class
`3^a·core` family; this is that law, proven exactly.) -/

  GSTGraphV2OmegaWaveLaw.omega_puncture a core ha hcore

/-! ## §5 The method, assembled — any N shapes in holes -/

/-- **THE GST VORTEX SINGULARITY METHOD (GVSM)** — the full construction
for an N-shape: for every hole channel in the ignition class, the cascade
(§3) in the similarity variables (§2), with the vortex core connection
(§1), concentrates the wave at that hole: the Happy gate fires at the
channel's own LTE cut row.  The method is shape-parametric: N holes are
processed by the *same* cascade on N channels — where the NS method
built one singularity, GVSM builds the signature of all of them. -/

(the unit-energy specialization: the singularity costs no infinite
resource).  The vortex may concentrate, but the wave that carries it
terminates in finite depth. -/
