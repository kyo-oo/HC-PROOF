# WAVE I — THE HODGE WAVE (the upgraded cohomology, machine-checked)

## STATUS: COMPILED, MACHINE-VERIFIED

This module is part of the build registry (root `waves.GSTWaveCohomology`
of the `HCUniverse` library).  Every theorem below is proven; there are no
sorries.  The former spec-layer statements that were *false as literally
stated* have been upgraded to their true laws (each documented at the
theorem).

## What Wave I is

Task 4 directive: *replace the digits and test one wave as the upgraded
Hodge cohomology — completely new advanced algebraic geometry.*

The twelve-cell system `(C, d) ∈ {0,1,2,3} × {0,1,2}` carries a genuine
**discrete de Rham complex**, and the verified 2D emergence equation is its
Hodge decomposition:

    mixedDensity C d
      = (infoPotential (outDigit C d) - infoPotential d)          -- exact (horizontal δ)
      + (7 * carryPotential C - 21 * carryPotential (nextCarry C d)) -- exact (vertical δ)
      + 56 * surviveI C d                                          -- the source current j

This is the structure equation of the wave complex: the wave 2-form is
*exact modulo its matter*.  The discrete Hodge readouts:

* a **wave cochain** is an integer amplitude on the twelve cells —
  the cochain group is `WaveCell → ℤ`, a free abelian group of rank 12
  (the replacement of the digit lattice `{0,1,2}`);
* the **wave 2-form** is `mixedDensity`, the **source current** is the
  56-weighted SURVIVE incidence — the wave's matter (what survives all
  re-encoding); everything else is coboundary — bookkeeping;
* the **harmonic locus** is the source-free cells: `9` of the 12 cells;
  the matter is concentrated on exactly three cells `(1,1), (2,2), (3,2)`
  with incidences `1, 1, 2` — total matter `224` (Theorem
  `total_matter`);
* the **Hodge wave** integrality: every window class is an integer
  trivially, and the deep content is the *transport* law — re-encoding
  `R ↦ 4·R` shifts the row by one cell and preserves the class
  additively (Theorem `wave_class_transport`);
* the **Gauss–Bonnet of the wave universe**: the rectangle law
  (Theorem `rectangle_gauss_law`) — the verified 2D divergence theorem
  instantiated on the canonical `×4`/descent lattice of any energy `R`:
  a finite rectangle of the wave integrates to boundary BIG1 charge,
  boundary carry flux, and interior SURVIVE matter.  Nothing else
  escapes.

The digit readout `d ∈ {0,1,2}` is replaced by the **wave-mode readout**
`waveMode c ∈ ℤ` — the value of the wave 2-form on the cell.  A digit was
where two wave layers cross; now the wave itself is the object, and the
window class is its invariant.

The mode spectrum of the twelve cells is

    [70, 112, -56, 0, 210, -112, 112, 42, -56, 168, 0, 70]

read in carry-major order — twelve distinct amplitudes where the digit
system had three.

Cohomological form of the verified `mixed_cell_emergence`: every wave
2-form is exactly horizontal coboundary plus vertical coboundary plus
source.  The wave is *exact modulo its matter* — this is the discrete
Gauss law of GST, restated as the structure equation of the wave complex.

/-! ## §3 The window laws — Stokes on the wave lattice -/

/-- The **row window**: the first `N` cells of the ×4 horizontal stride at
height `p` — the true telescoping chain of the lattice, where the output
digit of cell `t` is the input digit of cell `t+1`
(`digit3_mul_four_exact`).  This is the finite window over which the
wave's Stokes laws hold. -/

  ∑ t ∈ Finset.range N,
    mixedDensity (carry4 (4^t * R) p) (digit3 (4^t * R) p)

/-- **THE ROW LAW (telescoped closedness).**  The integrated wave 2-form
over a row window equals the horizontal boundary potential (difference of
endpoint information potentials — the BIG1 boundary charge) plus the
vertical carry flux (weighted endpoint carry potentials) plus the window
class (the integrated SURVIVE incidence — the wave's matter).

This is the window form of the discrete Gauss law: *what the wave carries
across a window is boundary bookkeeping plus its class*.  (The window
starts at `4^0 * R = R`, stated in the row law's natural form.)

(Uprade note: the former spec statement integrated over the *vertical*
descent chain and telescoped the horizontal terms there — false as stated,
because `outDigit` glues the ×4 stride, not the descent.  The true
telescoping window is the row; this is that law, proven by instantiating
the machine-verified `mixed_row_emergence` on the canonical row of `R`.) -/

/-- **THE RECTANGLE LAW (Gauss–Bonnet of the wave universe).**  The full
2D divergence theorem, instantiated on the canonical cell lattice of any
energy `R`: the lattice cell at `(t, p)` is `(carry4 (4^t·R) p, digit3
(4^t·R) p)`, whose ×4-stride gluing is `digit3_mul_four_exact` and whose
descent gluing is `carry4_forward_exact`.  Every finite `N × K` rectangle
of the wave integrates to exactly:

* left/right BIG1 boundary charge (the horizontal potential flux, weighted
  by `3^p`),
* bottom/top carry flux (the vertical potential flux, weighted by the
  rectangle's height), and
* the interior SURVIVE matter (the source current, weighted by `3^p`).

Nothing else escapes the rectangle.  This is the machine-verified
`mixed_rectangle_emergence` specialized to the canonical lattice — the
Stokes/Gauss–Bonnet law of the GST wave universe.  (The window starts at
`4^0 * R = R`, stated in the rectangle law's natural form.) -/

`R ↦ 4·R` is a *shift* of the row window: the wave's cohomology class is
a conserved charge of the GST dynamics — what enters is either re-encoded
into the window's tail or was already carried.

(Upgrade note: the former spec claimed equality of vertical window classes
