# Original GST Navigation controls the CM source without half-curvature artifacts

The owner's genuine predicate Navigation : Nat -> Prop is converted
into its already-constructed exact 0/1 rational navigationCharge.
This file connects THAT original physical arithmetic gate to the
original U/J/M/[J,M] source curvature family, rather than pretending
a freely chosen rational b was itself an original physical constant.

The half-strength resonance b=1/2 is a mathematically meaningful
interpolation obstruction but is NEVER a physical charge value.
Therefore every ACTUAL original navigation state retains the full
TWO-CELL independent native CM source, at any rational direct M strength.
This is NOT a claim of 12-state cyclicity at navigation-off inputs:
other ten-cell and cross-spectrum obstructions remain possible.
