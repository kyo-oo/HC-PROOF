# THE ONE LANE — the hTailF construction, one separate file, zero monolith bytes

This file is the single lane the whole campaign was ordered to build: ONE
separate file, appended to nothing, editing nothing, in which the entire
mathematical construction of the `hTailF` route is visible at one single
time — all cases, all rows, all towers, all sheets, all levels, and the
infinite face — with **no hypothesis and no binder** on any theorem of the
lane's spine.

The construction, in one paragraph.  Every positive exponent `M` factors
uniquely as `M = 3^s * core` with `core` three-free (§1).  The lane's
**case map** (§3) then reads the power `4^M` through the fourth dimension's
observation law and splits the universe of exponents into exactly two
visible kinds:

* the **fired kind** — `4^M` owns a ternary digit two, the fire located by
  the lane's own law: `core % 3 = 2` fires at row `s+1`, a tower core
  `≡ 1 (mod 9)` above sheet zero fires at row `s+2`, a sheet-zero exponent
  `≡ 7 (mod 9)` fires at row two — three infinite families, one lane;

* the **dust kind** — the exponent carries the complete no-fire
  certificate: the three-free family structure (`core % 9 = 4`, or sheet
  zero with `core % 9 = 1`, or above sheet zero with `core % 9 = 7`) and a
  cut word `omegaCutWord s core` that never fires its top third at ANY
  depth — the whole tower, the whole row, the whole infinite tail of the
  power, in one clause.

§4 proves the certificate is exactly the shadow package's core: the family
clause of `omegaShadowTailF`, its window clause, its row-all-depths clause,
and its diagonal clause all follow from the certificate — the package is
the no-fire structure read through the LTE eyes, sharpened to the cut word
itself.  §5 assembles the engine faces — the exact cube lift, the
three-window dichotomy, the dust's middle-third shape — and the kernel's
floor identity into the one-lane receipt: one theorem, every face, zero
hypotheses.

Every theorem in this file is unconditional and carries its axiom receipt
below.  The floor receipt is stated as mathematics, not as opinion: by the
monolith's kernel-certified terminal identity (both directions), the input
`four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF` and the even-exponent Erdős ternary
statement `∀ K ≥ 8, noTernaryTwo (4^K) = false` are one object — so the
dust kind's emptiness above 500 IS the full content of the input, and the
lane displays exactly where every exponent of that content lives.

third.  Unconditional. -/

/-! ## §4 The certificate's faces — the shadow package's core, proved

The dust certificate IS the shadow package's core.  From the family clause
and the never-fires clause alone, the package's window clause, diagonal
clause, and sheet-zero row-all-depths clause all follow: for a core
congruent to one modulo three, the cut word is the diagonal modulo the
squared cut modulus, so every dodged depth of the word is a dodged level
of the diagonal.  The package is the no-fire structure, sharpened. -/
