# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — TRANSPOSED GRAPH BETTI TRACE WITHOUT A TRACE AXIOM

For the transpose of a finite graph correspondence, the right algebraic leg is
literally the identity.  Its intrinsic analytic carrier is therefore the graph
locus `(f(x),x)`.  Projection to the second coordinate has a canonical
continuous section obtained from analytification of `f`.

Pullback along that section is an exact left inverse to right pullback on
rational singular cohomology.  Hence the degree-one `RightFiniteBettiTrace`
used by the strict-relation compiler is constructed rather than supplied.

No Hodge class, target state, cycle-class surjectivity, or desired operator
action occurs in the construction.
