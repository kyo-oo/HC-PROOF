# Original GST CM curvature / Hodge Star on EVERY complementary Hodge degree

From owner's image three:
  N-cohomology + Hodge cohomology + original complex J + true SURVIVE M
  + original [J,M] + Hodge Star, with original-X quantifiers retained.

Geometry in:
research/derivations/GST_owner_all_degree_HodgeStar_CM_graded_Ncohomology_20261111.tex

A genuine Hodge Star sends H^{2p} -> H^{2d-2p}, not generally back to
H^{2p}. The correct ALL-DEGREE carrier is a graded double P x Q with
D : P ≃ₗ[ℚ] Q, interpreted as the polarized rational Hodge-Star map
between complementary rational (p,p) Hodge fibers (when that map is
independently constructed via the rational Lefschetz decomposition).

On P x Q, define the exact SOURCE mechanism:
  Star(x,y) = (D^{-1} y, D x)
  J(x,y)    = (D^{-1} y, -D x)
  M(x,y)    = (0, 2y)
  [J,M]     = 2 Star.
This is the owner's original CM/SURVIVE fixed-pair algebra in EVERY degree.

This file proves the purely typed algebra and directly matches the
original user's 12-cell fixed-pair curvature. It does NOT assume that
Star is a genuine algebraic Chow correspondence on arbitrary X.
