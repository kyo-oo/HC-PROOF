# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — IRREDUCIBILITY OF GENERIC-POINT CLOSURE SCHEMES

The reduced subscheme built from `closure {x}` must retain the defining
irreducibility of a generic-point closure.  Mathlib's ideal-sheaf API identifies
the range of the subscheme inclusion with the ideal-sheaf support, while the
vanishing ideal has support exactly the closed set from which it was built.
Hence the point-closure subscheme is homeomorphic to `closure {x}`.

Since the closure of a singleton is irreducible, every point-closure scheme is
an irreducible Noetherian carrier.  This supplies the recursive domain on which
the proper-principal-cut codimension-one theorem can be reapplied at every
stage.
