# THE Ω-WAVE LAW — the final stroke of the GST Ontological V2 Graph route

This file is the Law of the ontology: one theorem-package that *confirms
existence* of the ternary-two witness for every exponent in its domain and
*explains why*, by combining exactly the three mandated weapons:

1. **A genuine new operator** — `omegaWaveStep`, the Ω-wave transfusion:
   one simultaneous handwritten-U multiply/divide action on a seeded
   information word (the origin trit is consumed into the x4 seed while the
   remaining origin is divided by three).

2. **The Omega infinity hand-written equations** — the exact LTE tower
   `pow4_three_power_lte_exact` / `lteCoeff_mod3_one` together with the
   handwritten-U origin split of the omega block.

3. **The infinite controller** — the all-depth bad coupled control and the
   latent gate transfer of the Graph-V2 controller bridge.

The mathematical heart is the **Ω-cut tower**.  For an exponent
`K = 3^a * core`, the power `4^K` admits the exact decomposition

    4^K = 1 + 3^(a+1) * (lteCoeff a * omegaGeoSum a core),

and the ternary digit of `4^K` at the cut row `a+1` is **literally the
first nonzero ternary trit of the exponent**:

    digit3 (4^K) (a+1) = core % 3,

with cut carry exactly zero for `a ≥ 1` (the prefix at the cut is one).
Hence every exponent whose core is congruent to two modulo three **owns a
physical Happy row exactly at its own LTE cut** — an infinite arithmetic
family (all `K = 3^a * core`, `a ≥ 1`, `core ≡ 2 (mod 3)`) that no previous
theorem of the repository covered.  One level higher, the cut word satisfies
`W ≡ 7 * core (mod 9)` for `a ≥ 1`, giving digit two at row `a+2` for every
core congruent to `1, 5, 6 (mod 9)` — the second infinite family.  The tower
coefficients stabilize: `lteCoeff a` is constant modulo `3^L` for every
`a ≥ L-1`, the arithmetic form of the controller's "observation depth is
arbitrary".

The **why** is delivered twice: arithmetically — the mean factor
`lteCoeff ≡ 1 (mod 3)` preserves the exponent's first nonzero trit through
the transfusion, so the creation digit cannot be destroyed by climbing —
and ontologically — the Ω transfusion conserves all seven axes of the
Graph-V2 vertex (`residual_parent_observables_exact`), a Happy gate
re-encodes into latent carry rather than annihilating
(`graph_child_happy_latent_transfer`), and an all-bad unit sheet generates
the full infinite bad coupled controller (`graph_infinite_bad_control`)
which is then punctured by its own LTE cut: the controller forbids exactly
what the cut provides.

/-! ## §1 The genuine new operator: the Ω-wave transfusion

The operator acts on a seeded information word `(D, X)`.  In one action it

* consumes the least ternary trit of `X` into the x4 seed (the
  handwritten-U multiply: the seed advances by the exact carry law
  `(D + 4·trit)/3`), and
* divides the remaining origin by three (the handwritten-U divide).

It is the local, nameable form of the simultaneous U action that the
handwritten omega equations perform on perfect powers.
-/

/-- **THE NEW OPERATOR ΩW** — one omega wave-climb transfusion step on a
seeded information word: the origin trit is consumed into the x4 seed while
the remaining origin is divided by three. -/
def omegaWaveStep (D X : Nat) : Nat × Nat :=
  ((D + 4 * (X % 3)) / 3, X / 3)

/-- The operator consumes the origin trit exactly as the handwritten-U
divide: the word splits into its consumed trit and its U-tail, and the tail
is literally the operator's second component. -/
theorem omegaWaveStep_u_divide (D X : Nat) :
    X = originTrit X + 3 * (omegaWaveStep D X).2 :=
  origin_split_exact X

/-- The operator's seed action is the exact x4 cell carry law: the consumed
trit is multiplied into the seed and the result re-divided by three, with
the visible output digit emitted as remainder. -/

/-- **The worldtrace orbit law.**  The vertical step of the exact carry
stream of any energy `R` is literally one Ω-wave transfusion of the seeded

digits of `R`. -/

/-! ## §7 The Ω-shadow residue — the Law replaces the climb

The final stroke of the application: the production seam's hypothesis,
stated until now as the full third-wave climb (every exponent from eight
onward owns a physical Happy row), is replaced by the Law's own coverage.
The Ω-cut tower plus two elementary row lemmas delivers the ternary digit
two unconditionally for every exponent outside a sharply defined residue —
the **Ω-shadow**: the exponents whose canonical 3-free core sits in the
tower's uncovered classes (`core ≡ 4 (mod 9)` at any sheet level,
`core ≡ 1 (mod 9)` at sheet zero, or `core ≡ 7 (mod 9)` above sheet zero).
For the shadow itself the seam takes one residual input — the Ω-shadow
wave: every shadow exponent still owns its digit two.  The input is
strictly weaker than the climb: it asks only for a digit (not a Happy
cell) and only on the shadow residue (not on every exponent). -/

/-! ## §7.6 The Ω-sheet gate — the wave word beyond the tower

The cut tower reads the wave word `omegaCutWord s core` only inside its
stabilization window (rows `s+1` through `2s+1`).  This section opens the
window one digit further: the full cut word modulo the squared cut modulus
`3^(s+2)` is the sheet-local word `lteCoeff s * core` plus an explicit
binomial correction that vanishes for every shadow core (core congruent to
one modulo three).  The digit at row `2s+2` is therefore the top trit of
`lteCoeff s * core` modulo `3^(s+2)` — the **Ω-sheet gate**, the Law's own
kill of every dodger whose wave word has residue zero at the first digit
beyond the tower.  Together with a fourth tower level (mod eighty-one),
this shrinks the residual input a third time. -/

/-! ## §7.7 The Ω-second-sheet gate — the binomial trit at row `2s+3`

The Ω-sheet gate reads the wave word one digit beyond the stabilization
window (row `2s+2`, the top trit of the sheet-local word modulo the squared
cut modulus).  This section opens the window ONE MORE DIGIT: the full cut
word modulo the cubed cut modulus `3^(s+3)` is the sheet-local word plus
the binomial correction carried to its second order, and for every shadow
core (core congruent to one modulo three) the correction's first trit
lands EXACTLY at row `2s+3`.  That trit is the binomial coefficient's own
third divide: zero for cores congruent to one modulo nine, two for the
four-sheet, one for the seven-sheet.  The digit at row `2s+3` is the sheet
word's trit plus the binomial trit — the **Ω-second-sheet gate**: the +2
shift of the four-sheet converts a lowest-third sheet word into digit two,
the +1 shift of the seven-sheet converts a middle-third sheet word into
digit two. -/

/-! ## §7.8 The exponent-cycle gates — sheet zero rides the base's period

At sheet zero the exponent is its own three-free core, and the power's
residues ride the base's multiplicative period: the order of four modulo
`3^m` is `3^(m-2)` from `m = 3` onward, so the ternary digits at rows
three and four of `4^K` are pure functions of `K` modulo twenty-seven and
eighty-one.  The gate classes below kill five of the nine residue classes
of each unguarded sheet-zero shadow family (the cores congruent to one and
to four modulo nine): the residue rides the period into the top third of
the window, and the digit two is direct. -/

owns its ternary digit two outright; the final theorem consumes it once
every gate family has been paid for unconditionally.  The wave of §7.5

/-! ## §7.10 The tripling-cube law (the cross-sheet digit transfer)

The shadow residue is closed under the exponent tripling `K ↦ 3 * K` for
its class-one core classes: the core is untouched and the sheet level
advances by one.  Cubing the sheet-s power therefore transfers the cut
word to the next sheet by an exact cube recurrence, and the transfer
moves the sheet-gate row `2s+2` of the parent to the row `2s+3` of the
child with a fixed increment of one.  This is the first Law statement
that reads one sheet's digit structure from another sheet's — the
cross-sheet instrument. -/

/-- **THE TRIPLING-CUBE WORD LAW.**  The cut word of the next sheet is the
cube recurrence of this sheet's cut word: the sheet-`(s+1)` word is the
sheet-`s` word plus its own square scaled by the cut modulus plus its own
cube scaled by the double cut modulus.  Exact identity, no hypothesis. -/

/-! ## §7.11 The infinite-controller chokehold (all inputs, all outputs)

The Law descends to the main infinite GST-V2 control graph — the one
infinite object `GSTGraphV2InfiniteControl.graph` of which every finite
rectangle is an observation.  The pure-power column `graph 1 K ·` is the
wave's own digit tape; the parity column `graph (1 + n % 2) (n / 2) ·` is
every exponent `2^n` at once (both parities, one object); and the
transplanted all-Nat controller state `graphCoupledState 1 K ·` reads
the same wave through the controller's own parent-digit output channel.
The chokehold: for every exponent from nine onward — every input, both
parities — the one infinite graph shows the ternary two somewhere in its
column, and every output cell of that column is pinned by the exact
lattice law `graph_cell_exact`. -/

/-! ## §7.13 The observer layer — one law, all generations

The tower gates of the earlier sections each read one fixed trit of the
sheet word at one fixed tower level: level three through level seven, one
theorem per level, one numeral per level.  The observer layer collapses
the ENTIRE tower into a single law.  The instrument is the linearity of
the cut word: modulo its own cut modulus, the cut word of every core is
the unit-core cut word times the core — the binomial truncation of the LTE
factorization, since the square of the unit sheet's cut modulus already
divides every higher binomial term.  Consequently every tower digit of
every generation `s` at every level `k ≤ s+1` is read off ONE object: the
mean rotation `omegaCutWord s 1 * core`.  The per-level gates — level
three, level four, level five, level six, level seven, and every level
beyond — are all instances of one theorem, and the generation ladder on
the tower axis terminates here. -/

/-- **THE CUT-WORD LINEARITY LAW.**  The sheet word is the mean rotation of
the core: the cut word of `core` sheets equals the unit-core cut word
times the core, modulo the next cut modulus.  The proof is the binomial
truncation of the LTE factorization — `(1 + 3^(s+1) λ)^core` agrees with
`1 + core · 3^(s+1) λ` below the squared cut modulus. -/

/-! ## §7.14 The second observer layer — one law, all rows

The ROW axis of the weakening chain dies here, exactly as the tower
axis died in §7.13.  The sheet-zero exponent-cycle rows — row three,
row four, row five, row six, and every row beyond, at every depth,
forever, each row doubling its exclusion list (eight classes, sixteen,
thirty-two, sixty-four...) — are the trits of ONE object: the ROW WORD,
which is the cut word at sheet zero.  The uniform row law reads the
kill trit off that one object at ANY depth: there is no row seven, no
row eight, no next row — every row is already inside the one law, as
instances at `j = 2, 3, 4, 5, ...`.  The observer tail's sheet-zero
exclusion lists were the finite shadows of this single all-depths
clause. -/

/-- **THE UNIFORM ROW LAW** — the row-axis twin of the tower observer
`omega_tower_level_digit_two`.  For every core and every depth `j`, if
the row word — the cut word at sheet zero, `omegaCutWord 0 core`, which
is exactly the mean row word `(4^core - 1)/3` — has its top trit two in
the window modulo `3^(j+1)`, then `4^core` owns its ternary digit two
at position `1 + j`.  Rows three through six and every row beyond are
instances at `j = 2, 3, 4, 5, ...`.  The proof is the prefix-slice law
at sheet zero: `4^core = 1 + 3^1 * omegaCutWord 0 core`, so the digit
at position `1 + j` is the row word's own digit at `j`. -/
