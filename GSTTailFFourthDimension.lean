# THE 4TH DIMENSION — the tailF observation chamber

The separate arena for the second-observer input
`four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF`: the entire theorem machinery of the
route — the observation law, the descent blade, the diagonal ignition, the
uniform row and tower gates — assembled in ONE file, and pointed at the
input's own package.

What this chamber delivers, machine-certified:

* **THE EXTENDED OBSERVATION LAW** (`tower_observation_digit_two`): the
  row-axis reading of the Law, lifted from sheet zero to EVERY sheet level.
  Every tower digit of `4^(3^s * core)` at EVERY depth — no window bound,
  positions far beyond the observer law's `k ≤ s+1` window — is the cut
  word's own trit. The deep zone of the power, beyond the package's dodge
  band, is readable off `omegaCutWord s core` directly.
* **THE DESCENT BLADE** (§2, four theorems): the cut-word tower is one
  stabilizing 3-adic object; ONE primitive diagonal trit two kills the
  tower dodge at every level at once.
* **THE DIAGONAL IGNITION** (§3 + §3b, nineteen theorems): the firing
  bands as unconditional residue tests on the core — the first bands
  (levels two and three) and the deep bands (levels four and five), every
  band's domain reaching infinity: one residue test kills the whole tower
  from its level upward.
* **THE DECOMPOSITION** (§4): the input `four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF`
  is EXACTLY two named 3-adic trit statements — the row primitive (the
  sheet-zero family: the row word of every 3-free class-one core fires) and
  the tower primitive (the deep tail of every diagonal-dodging tower fires
  at depth beyond its own window). Both composition directions are
  machine-certified, and through the monolith's own terminal identity and
  crown, the two primitives carry the whole even-exponent statement.

The two named primitives are the carried content of the input — stated as
`def`s, consumed as hypotheses, disclosed at every surface. Everything
around them in this file is unconditional and axiom-audited.

/-! ## §1 The extended observation law — every tower digit, every depth

The uniform row law of the Law file reads the digits of `4^core` off the
row word `omegaCutWord 0 core` at every depth `j`. The cut-factor identity
`4^(3^s * core) = 1 + 3^(s+1) * omegaCutWord s core` holds at EVERY sheet
level `s`, and the prefix-slice law applies at every one of them: the
digit of the tower power at position `s+1+j` is the cut word's own trit at
`j`, with NO window bound. This is the observation law of the fourth
dimension: the deep digits — the positions the package's dodge band does
not even reach — are an open book. -/

/-- **THE EXTENDED OBSERVATION LAW.**  For every sheet level `s`, every
core, and EVERY depth `j`: whenever the cut word's own trit at depth `j`
sits in the top third of its residue window modulo `3^(j+1)`, the tower
power `4^(3^s * core)` owns its ternary digit two at position `s+1+j`.
No window bound: the reading works at every depth of the power. -/

/-! ## §2 The descent blade — the non-local argument

The cut-word tower is one stabilizing 3-adic object: the cube-lift identity

primitive level, and ONE primitive diagonal trit two kills the tower dodge
at EVERY sheet level at once. -/

the cut word of level `s` plus a multiple of `3^(s+1)`: every trit below

/-! ## §3b The deep ignition — levels four and five, domains to infinity

The ignition machinery of §3 reads the primitive diagonal at ANY index,
not only the first two: the level-three tower word is
`222399981598543 ≡ 16 (mod 81)`, the level-four tower word is
`24057640120673299065081231814259802792690247621 ≡ 178 (mod 243)` — each
a fixed certificate of the same stabilized Ω-word — and every hard-family
residue class whose product with the word lands in the top third of its
window fires the diagonal at that index. The descent blade then kills the
WHOLE tower of that class from the level upward: the class's domain
reaches infinity in one residue test.

Level four fires the four classes `4, 34, 49, 70 (mod 81)`; level five
fires the eight classes `16, 31, 61, 76, 124, 139, 169, 184 (mod 243)`.
Twelve hard-family classes die wholesale here — on top of the two of §3 —
and the survivor measure of the hard family shrinks from the eight
mod-81 classes to sixteen mod-243 classes: exactly one third of each
level's survivors fire, the Cantor arithmetic of the dodge set, now
formalized two levels deeper than the chamber's first ignition. -/

/-! ## §4 The two named primitives — the decomposition of the input

The input `four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF` says: every exponent above
the kernel base that carries the full shadow package owns a ternary digit
two. The package's own witness decomposition `K = 3^s * core` splits the
input into exactly two families, and each family compresses to ONE named
3-adic trit statement:

* the **ROW primitive** — the sheet-zero family (`s = 0`): the row word of
  every 3-free class-one core above the base fires its top third at some
  depth;
* the **TOWER primitive** — the tower family (`s ≥ 1`): the deep tail of
  the cut word — beyond the package's own dodge band, at depth `≥ s+2` —
  fires its top third at some depth.

These two statements are the whole carried content of the input: composed,
they deliver the input outright, and through the monolith's terminal
identity and crown they deliver the even-exponent statement itself. -/

/-- **THE ROW PRIMITIVE** — the sheet-zero family's entire carried content,

/-- **THE TOWER PRIMITIVE** — the tower family's entire carried content, as

/-! ## §5 The combinations applied — the package's own bands die

The blade and the ignition, pointed at the input's own package: for the
mod-27 firing band, the package's tower-dodge clause is dead on arrival —
the diagonal fires inside the clause's own window, so no package witness
at sheet level two or beyond can carry a band core. This is the machinery
of §§1-3 consuming the package from the fourth dimension. -/

/-- **THE BAND DODGE IS DEAD.**  For every sheet level `s ≥ 2` and every
core in the mod-27 firing band (`13` or `25` mod 27), the tower-dodge
clause of the shadow package FAILS at `k = 3`: the stabilized tower word
fires its top third inside the clause's own window. No package witness at
level two or beyond carries a band core. -/

/-! ## §6 The row lattice — the sheet-zero residual, fired three levels deep

The row half of the carried input, attacked directly on the powers.  The
hard family of the sheet-zero decomposition is `core % 9 ∈ {1, 4}` (3-free,
above the kernel base); the residue class of the core modulo `3^m` pins the
ternary digits of `4 ^ core` up to position `m` through the cycle laws —
the monolith's own `four_pow_mod81` at level 27, and the two new cycle laws
of this section at levels 81 and 243.  Three lattice levels, thirteen fired
classes:

* level 27, digit position 3: classes `19` and `22` mod 27 —
  `4 ^ core % 81 = 58` and `67`;
* level 81, digit position 4: classes `55, 58, 64, 67` mod 81 —
  `4 ^ core % 243 = 166, 175, 193, 202`;
* level 243, digit position 5: classes `85, 91, 112, 163, 175, 190, 202`
  mod 243 — `4 ^ core % 729 = 499, 517, 580, 490, 526, 571, 607`.

Every fired class owns its digit two UNCONDITIONALLY — no package, no
input, no gates.  The carried row input of §4 shrinks to the seventeen
survivors of the mod-243 level (§7): the replacement of the input's row
half. -/

/-! ## §8 The row lattice, level six — the survivors fired one level deeper

The lattice's fourth level.  The cycle law now pins the modulus-2187 residue
of `4 ^ core` by the class of `core` modulo 729, and each of the seventeen
mod-243 survivor classes splits into three mod-729 subclasses — of which
exactly ONE fires.  The level-six lattice kills one third of the surviving
residue content unconditionally; the carried row input shrinks from the
seventeen mod-243 classes to thirty-four mod-729 classes — twice the count,
but each class one third as wide, and seventeen more classes of the hard
family closed outright:

/-! ## §9 The meta-view — every class, every case, every level, one law

The fourth dimension's own vantage point, assembled: the ignition
machinery of §3, §3b, and every deeper level of the ladder is ONE law,
uniform in the level index.  The fire predicate — the tower word of the
core sitting in the top third of its window at level `k` — is a single
decidable test on `(k, core)`; the uniform law converts it into the
primitive diagonal trit two at EVERY level; the descent blade then kills
the core's ENTIRE tower from that level upward.  The level-by-level grind
— the fourteen fire laws of §3 and §3b, the lattice levels of §§6-8, and
every level beyond them — is the INSIDE of this one law: each is an
instance, obtained by feeding the law one residue certificate.

The exact complement is the SURVIVOR DUST: the cores whose tower word
dodges the top third at every level from three upward — one predicate,
the whole dodge set of the cascade seen at once.  Every core outside the
dust is dead by machine: a fire exists, and the blade kills every sheet
from its level upward, in one statement.  The dust's own members are the
tower primitive's exact residual — §4's decomposition, the diagonal
restatement below, and the floor receipt of the proof file carry the full
map. -/

/-- **THE UNIFORM IGNITION — every level, every core, one law.**  Whenever
the level-`k` tower word of `core` — `omegaCutWord (k-1) 1 * core` — sits
in the top third of its window modulo `3^k`, the primitive diagonal fires:
`4^(3^(k-1) * core)` owns its ternary digit two at index `2k - 1`.
Unconditional and uniform in `k` and `core`: every fire law of §3, §3b,
and every deeper level of the ladder is an instance of this single
theorem. -/

uniform ignition composed with the descent blade: for every level `k`,

/-! ## §7c The wave engine — the cube lift, exact — one lane, all sheets

The engine of the whole cascade, exposed as a named law: the cut word of
sheet level `s+1` is the cut word of level `s` plus `3^(s+1)` times
`(W^2 + 3^s · W^3)` — the EXACT cube lift, no existential remainder.  The
stabilization law of §2 said `∃ t`; the engine names `t`.  From it: the
**+1 lift law** — for every three-free core, whenever the sheet's own
window trit is `w`, the next frozen diagonal trit is `w + 1` — and its two
children: the **three-window dichotomy** (every sheet of every three-free
core either FIRES its own digit two at position `2s+2`, or DODGES with
window trit zero, or ESCALATES — window trit one, and the descent blade
kills every sheet above at once), and the **escalation law** (a core whose
windows all dodge can never park its diagonal in the bottom third — with
the dust hypothesis, the dust's exact shape is the MIDDLE THIRD at every
level from three upward).  All sheets, all rows, all towers: one lane. -/

/-- The cut word's zeroth trit is the core's residue: the LTE mean is one
modulo three and the geometric mean is the core modulo three. -/

/-- **THE ESCALATION LAW — a dodging core never parks its diagonal in the
bottom third.**  If every sheet `s ≥ 1` of a three-free core dodges its
own window (the shadow package's clause A, all sheets at once), then at
every level `k ≥ 3` the scaled diagonal `omegaCutWord (k-1) 1 * core`
sits at or above the middle of its window: the `+1` lift advances the
frozen diagonal one full trit per sheet, and a window-dodging sheet
advances from zero, one, never from minus one.  The window dodge feeds
the diagonal; the diagonal cannot hide low. -/
