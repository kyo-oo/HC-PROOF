# General-Space primitive middle cycle for P^m x P^m, ALL m

The actual smooth projective complex variety
    X_m = P^m_C × P^m_C
has rational cohomology ring
    Q[a,b]/(a^(m+1),b^(m+1))
and ample hyperplane class h=a+b.
The degree-2m middle Betti classes have basis
    a^(m-j) b^j, j=0,...,m.

Cup with h acts by ADDING ADJACENT COEFFICIENTS:
    L(c)_j=c_j+c_(j+1), j=0,...,m-1.
This file proves for EVERY m (no sampled bound) that the
kernel of that actual middle-degree Lefschetz matrix
is the ONE-DIMENSIONAL line with alternating coefficients:
    c_j = c_0*(-1)^j.

The primitive generator is the EXPLICIT algebraic cycle
    Z_m = Σ_(j=0)^m (-1)^j H_1^(m-j) ⋅ H_2^j
where H_1,H_2 are the genuine algebraic hyperplane divisors
on the two projective factors. It is nonzero, killed by the
ample class, and accounts for every rational middle-primitive
class on this full arbitrarily-high-dimensional family.

Important provenance: Lean below independently verifies the
complete rational coefficient classification and nonzero
algebraic-cycle-coordinate construction. The IDENTIFICATION
of these coefficients with actual Betti cup and intersection
on projective spaces uses the standard classical integral
cohomology ring theorem, which is not part of this module.
It does NOT prove primitive Hodge surjectivity for arbitrary
smooth projective varieties.

/-! ## All-X primitive-to-middle projective stabilization

NEW EXACT GST LAW: Given a primitive rational Hodge class alpha of
codimension p on an arbitrary d-fold with 2p <= d, set m=d-2p and
Y=X×P^m. The middle class on Y

   B = sum_{j=0}^m (-1)^j
          pr_X^*(h_X^j alpha) * pr_P^*(h_P^(m-j))

is PRIMITIVE for the product polarization h_X+h_P: all interior
coefficients cancel, the bottom boundary is h_P^(m+1)=0,
and the top boundary is the original Lefschetz-primitivity relation
h_X^(m+1) alpha=0. Pushing B down along pr_X recovers alpha exactly.

This module proves all arbitrary-rank, arbitrary-m rational-linear
coefficient identities. Their identification with actual Betti
classes and algebraic Chow pushforward uses the standard projective
bundle formula/projection formula, which are not re-proved here.
The reduction is NONCIRCULAR; it does NOT establish universal
existence of the required primitive middle algebraic representative.
