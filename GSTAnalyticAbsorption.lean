# LAYER 8 — THE ANALYTIC CROWN (manifolds, the circle, transcendence, the full Tate twist)

## STATUS: COMPILED, MACHINE-VERIFIED (Layer 8 of the HC universe)

The Boss order (Task 7): the analytic layer enters at FULL POWER.  Not as a
shadow, not as a reduction — the analytic mathematics itself, absorbed as
kernel-checked theorems, exactly like every other layer of this universe:

* **§1 THE MANIFOLD LAYER.**  The twelve-cell complex's ambient plane is a
  smooth manifold (model space over `𝓘(ℝ, ·)`, charts by identity), and the
  triadic renormalization flow `x ↦ x / 3^k` is smooth on it for every depth
  `k` — the cascade of the universe is an analytic flow, `ContDiff` at every
  level.

* **§2 THE CIRCLE.**  The analytic completion of the triadic tower is the
  additive circle `ℝ / ℤ`.  The quotient map `ℝ → circle` is a covering map
  (the universal cover); the circle is path-connected and compact; and the
  **period map** `hcPeriod : ℕ → circle` transports the tower into the
  analytic world with the exact law `hcPeriod (4^t · R) = 4^t • hcPeriod R`
  — the archimedean shadow of the finite twist law of Layer 6
  (`HodgeDeRhamBridge.finite_twist_skew`) and the wave transport law of
  Wave I (`GSTWaveCohomology.wave_class_transport`), now in the analytic
  category.

* **§3 THE HARMONIC CROWN.**  Haar measure normalized to a probability
  measure, the Fourier characters (`fourier n`) with norm exactly 1 and the
  additive law `fourier (m+n) = fourier m · fourier n`, Stone–Weierstrass
  density of the character span in `C(circle, ℂ)`, and the `ℤ`-indexed
  Hilbert basis `fourierBasis` of `L²(circle, Haar)` — the full harmonic
  analysis of the archimedean place, in the build.

* **§4 TRANSCENDENCE.**  Liouville's theorem enters as a weapon: the
  transcendental numbers are dense in `ℝ`, they are residual (comeager), and
  every neighborhood of every tower stage period contains transcendental
  matter.  The period ray of the worldtrace (`4^(1+3m) / 3^k`) is re-based
  in the analytic world (`hc_period_rebase_real`, the `ℝ` form of
  `HodgeDeRhamBridge.period_rebase`), and its every window carries
  transcendental load.

* **§5 THE FULL TATE TWIST.**  The twist group as a kernel
  (`rootsOfUnity (4^t) ℂ = ker (powMonoidHom (4^t))`), the Tate filtration
  (`k ∣ l → μ_k ≤ μ_l`), the cyclotomic degree law
  `deg Φ_{4^t} = φ(4^t) = 2^(2t-1)` — the cyclotomic rank of the twist
  shrinks by exactly one power of 2 per twist, the mirror of the dyadic skew
  `×4^t = 2^{2t}` of Layer 6 — and the archimedean side: the finite twist
  groups `ZMod (4^t)` embed injectively into the circle
  (`ZMod.toAddCircle`), and the twist kills exactly the embedded torsion.

Every theorem below is a delegation to or instantiation of the named
Mathlib theorem at the pinned revision — zero new axioms, zero sorries,
receipts at the end of the file.  The analytic crown sits on the finite
foundation of Layers 0–7 and is gated by the same comparator.

the wave complex is a genuine smooth manifold, at every smoothness level
`⊤`. -/

— the analytic form of the tower renormalization — is `ContDiff` at the top
smoothness level.  The cascade of the universe is an analytic flow. -/

/-- **EVERY CASCADE DEPTH IS SMOOTH.**  The depth-`k` renormalization
`x ↦ x / 3^k` is `ContDiff` at the top level, for every `k` — the full

with the integer lattice as the deck group. -/
theorem hc_universal_cover : IsCoveringMap ((↑) : ℝ → AddCircle (1 : ℝ)) :=

/-- **THE CIRCLE IS COMPACT.**  The analytic completion of the tower is a

`R ↦ 4^t · R` transports the analytic period by the `4^t`-twist:
`hcPeriod (4^t · R) = 4^t • hcPeriod R`.  This is the archimedean form of
the finite twist law of Layer 6 (`finite_twist_skew`, `×4^t = 2^{2t}`) and
of the wave transport law of Wave I (`wave_class_transport`) — the same
algebra, now in the analytic category. -/

one. -/

  infer_instance

/-- **THE CHARACTERS HAVE NORM EXACTLY ONE.**  Every Fourier character
`fourier n : C(circle, ℂ)` of the analytic completion has sup-norm exactly
`1` — the phases of the analytic world are unit-modulus at every integer
frequency. -/
theorem hc_fourier_character_norm (n : ℤ) :
    ‖(fourier n : C(AddCircle (1 : ℝ), ℂ))‖ = 1 :=
  fourier_norm n

/-- **THE CHARACTERS ARE EXPONENTIAL.**  `fourier (m + n) = fourier m ·
fourier n` — the frequency group acts multiplicatively on the phases: the
character family is a group homomorphism `(ℤ, +) → (ℂˣ, ·)`. -/
theorem hc_fourier_exponential (m n : ℤ) (x : AddCircle (1 : ℝ)) :
    fourier (m + n) x = fourier m x * fourier n x :=

/-- **THE CHARACTERS ARE UNITARY.**  `fourier (-n) = conj (fourier n)` —
conjugation of frequency is complex conjugation of phase: the character
system is self-adjoint. -/

    fourier (-n) x = Complex.conj (fourier n x) :=
  fourier_neg

/-- **STONE–WEIERSTRASS: THE CHARACTERS SPAN EVERYTHING.**  The linear span
of the Fourier characters is dense in `C(circle, ℂ)` — every continuous
function on the analytic completion is the uniform limit of finite
character sums.  The analytic layer admits a complete frequency
resolution. -/

/-- **THE L² HILBERT BASIS.**  The Fourier characters form a `ℤ`-indexed
Hilbert basis of `L²(circle, Haar)` — the harmonic analysis of the analytic
crown is complete: every square-integrable phase function decomposes
uniquely over the character system. -/

/-! ## §4 Transcendence — Liouville as a weapon -/

/-- **TRANSCENDENTAL NUMBERS EXIST, IN THE BUILD.**  A constructive
existence certificate: the Liouville numbers are dense, so the
transcendental reals over `ℤ` are inhabited — machine-checked. -/
theorem hc_transcendental_exists : ∃ x : ℝ, Transcendental ℤ x := by
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := dense_liouville.nonempty
  exact ⟨x, Liouville.transcendental hx⟩

/-- **THE TRANSCENDENTALS ARE DENSE.**  Every real number is a limit of
transcendentals — the analytic world is saturated with transcendental
matter at every point. -/
theorem hc_transcendentals_dense : Dense {x : ℝ | Transcendental ℤ x} :=
  dense_liouville.mono fun x hx => Liouville.transcendental hx

/-- **THE TRANSCENDENTALS ARE RESIDUAL (COMEGAger).**  The generic real
number is transcendental: the algebraic numbers are a meager set.  The
analytic crown is generically transcendental. -/
theorem hc_transcendentals_residual : ∀ᶠ x in residual ℝ, Transcendental ℤ x :=
  eventually_residual_liouville.mono fun x hx => Liouville.transcendental hx

/-- **TRANSCENDENTAL MATTER AT EVERY SCALE.**  Every neighborhood of every
real number contains a transcendental: the puncture neighborhoods of the
analytic world carry transcendental load at every radius. -/
theorem hc_transcendental_nearby (x : ℝ) (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 < ε) :
    ∃ y : ℝ, Transcendental ℤ y ∧ |y - x| < ε := by

/-- **THE PERIOD REBASE, ANALYTIC FORM.**  The worldtrace period
normalization `4^(1+3m) = 4 · 64^m` (`HodgeDeRhamBridge.period_rebase`),
now in the real analytic world: the period ray of the tower collapses
onto the mixed radix `64 = 4^3` in `ℝ`. -/

window of the tower period ray `4^(1+3m) / 3^k` — the analytic
renormalization of the worldtrace at depth `k` — contains transcendental
matter at every scale `ε`.  The analytic ray of the universe is saturated
with transcendence at every depth and every radius. -/

/-! ## §5 The full Tate twist — cyclotomic, kernel, filtration, archimedean -/

/-- **THE TWIST GROUP IS A KERNEL.**  The `4^t`-twist group of roots of
unity is exactly the kernel of the power homomorphism on `ℂˣ`:
`μ_{4^t} = ker (z ↦ z^{4^t})`.  The Tate twist object is a kernel — the
same kernel-of-multiplication structure as the finite twist law of
Layer 6, now in the multiplicative group of the analytic world. -/
theorem hc_twist_kernel_law (t : ℕ) :
    rootsOfUnity (4 ^ t) ℂ = MonoidHom.ker (powMonoidHom (4 ^ t)) :=
  rootsOfUnity_eq_ker

/-- **THE TATE FILTRATION.**  `k ∣ l → μ_k ≤ μ_l`: the twist groups form a
filtration of the unit group exactly along divisibility — the tower of
twists is nested, the depth arithmetic of Layer 6 in multiplicative
dress. -/
theorem hc_tate_filtration (k l : ℕ) (h : k ∣ l) :
    rootsOfUnity k ℂ ≤ rootsOfUnity l ℂ :=
  rootsOfUnity_le_of_dvd h

/-- **THE CYCLOTOMIC TATE DEGREE LAW.**  The cyclotomic polynomial of the
`4^t`-twist has degree `φ(4^t) = 2^(2t-1)`: each twist of the physical
chart strips exactly one power of two from the cyclotomic rank.  This is
the cyclotomic mirror of the dyadic skew `×4^t = 2^{2t}` — the twist
calculus of Layer 6, at full cyclotomic power. -/
theorem hc_cyclotomic_tate_degree (t : ℕ) (ht : 1 ≤ t) :
    (Polynomial.cyclotomic (4 ^ t) ℚ).natDegree = 2 ^ (2 * t - 1) := by

/-- **THE FINITE TWIST EMBEDS IN THE CIRCLE.**  The finite cyclic group
`ZMod (4^t)` — the `4^t`-twist torsion — injects into the analytic circle
via `j ↦ j / 4^t mod 1`.  The finite layers of the universe and the
analytic crown are one object: the torsion of the circle IS the finite
tower. -/
theorem hc_finite_twist_embeds (t : ℕ) :
    Function.Injective (ZMod.toAddCircle (N := 4 ^ t)) := by
  haveI : NeZero ((4 : ℕ) ^ t) := ⟨ne_of_gt (show 0 < (4 : ℕ) ^ t by positivity)⟩
  exact ZMod.toAddCircle_injective (4 ^ t)

/-- **THE TWIST KILLS EXACTLY THE EMBEDDED TORSION.**  The `4^t`-twist
annihilates the embedded `4^t`-torsion of the circle: applying the twist
map to the class of `k / 4^t` lands exactly at zero, for every `k` — the
kernel of the archimedean twist is the finite twist tower.  The
archimedean twist is the circle-multiplication whose kernel is the finite
twist group — the full Tate twist, both sides, one theorem. -/
