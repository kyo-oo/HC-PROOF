# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — SELF-EXPANDING COSMIC CLOSURE

This file does not make Hodge geometry a fixed collection of nodes in a fixed
graph.  Instead it interprets the genuine classical objects as states living
inside distinguished worlds of a much larger `SelfExpandingCosmos`.

The ambient cosmos may contain arbitrarily many additional worlds, including
worlds not anticipated by the Hodge formalization.  The cycle, Betti, and Hodge
worlds below are only marked branches inside it.

Two independent closures matter:

1. **world closure** — the relevant geometry worlds themselves must be born
   from the three GST roots through certified world-generation events;
2. **state closure** — every genuine Hodge state must be causally generated
   from genuine algebraic-cycle states through semantic-preserving state flow.

When both are achieved we call the realization `CompleteCosmicClosure`.
The exact rational Hodge statement follows from the state half, while the world
half records the stronger cosmological claim that the geometry was generated
inside GST rather than externally attached to it.
