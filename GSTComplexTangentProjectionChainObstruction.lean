# GST Hodge geometric surgery: complex-tangent projection is NOT a chain map

Original all-X target: an integral homology preserving chain-level operator
that turns the primitive component of an ample-shifted Hodge cycle into a
Kähler-calibrated holomorphic integral current.

This file isolates a genuine differential-geometric obstruction to
a tempting LOCAL route: project each current tangent plane / differential
form to the J-invariant (1,1) component, then declare it a closed current.
The J-type projector does NOT commute with the exterior differential,
already on a projective square elliptic product E x E and in the ZERO
cohomology class.

Choose real global coordinates x,y,u,v on E x E, and J acting by
J* dx = -dy, J* dy=dx, J* du=-dv, J* dv=du.

Take the smooth 2-form
  omega = cos(x) dx ∧ du
which is EXACT since omega = d(sin(x) du), hence d omega = 0.
The real (1,1) projector is
  pi11 omega = (cos(x)/2)(dx ∧ du + dy ∧ dv).
But
  d(pi11 omega) = -(sin(x)/2) dx ∧ dy ∧ dv ≠ 0.

Therefore an arbitrary chain-level Hodge projector cannot be built
by pointwise complex-tangent projection. The missing universal GST
surgery must simultaneously CORRECT THE BOUNDARY and preserve integer
multiplicity and homology; no abstract N-window coordinate identity
proves that correction exists.

Lean verifies the exact rational Fourier-coefficient matrix, not the
entire analytic complex manifold theorem. There is NO claim of Hodge
completion or a bogus all-X geometric calibration operator.
