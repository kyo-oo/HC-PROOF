# Universal Hodge: CM–NM obstruction and source–target geometry audit

This file is an adversarial check against a false unconditional completion.
It does NOT add any axiom, arbitrary cycle witness, or artificial Hodge action.

1. The imaginary-quadratic CM operator polynomial
     T² - 2aT + (a²+b²)I = 0, b != 0
   CANNOT hold on the rational one-dimensional vector space Q.
   Thus the earlier rank-two CM forcing cannot serve as a single
   UNIVERSAL operator law, notably for a rank-one Hodge fiber.
   This does not refute CM arithmetic on even-dimensional factors.
2. Any actual realized algebraic cross-carrier correspondence sends
   a class of an actual algebraic source cycle to the actual algebraic
   cycle-class range of its destination. If beta is NOT algebraic,
   it is impossible for beta to be obtained by any such transfer of
   an algebraic source cycle. More compositions of old transfers
   do not independently create algebraicity of arbitrary beta.

A path to an unconditional Hodge proof must supply a NEW actual
geometric construction for the arbitrary missing target class
(or establish a genuinely universal geometric mechanism beyond
transfer closure). Giving names to conditional CM/NM transfers
does not discharge this implication.
