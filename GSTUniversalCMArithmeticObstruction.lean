# Universal Hodge: CM–NM obstruction and source–target geometry audit

This file is an adversarial check against a false unconditional completion.
It does NOT add any axiom, arbitrary cycle witness, or artificial Hodge action.

1. The imaginary-quadratic CM operator polynomial
     T² - 2aT + (a²+b²)I = 0, b != 0
   CANNOT hold on the rational one-dimensional vector space Q.
   Thus the earlier rank-two CM forcing cannot serve as a single
   UNIVERSAL operator law, notably for a rank-one Hodge fiber.
   This does not refute CM arithmetic on even-dimensional factors.
2. Any actual realized algebraic cross-carrier correspondence sends
   a class of an actual algebraic source cycle to the actual algebraic
   cycle-class range of its destination. If beta is NOT algebraic,
   it is impossible for beta to be obtained by any such transfer of
   an algebraic source cycle. More compositions of old transfers
   do not independently create algebraicity of arbitrary beta.

A path to an unconditional Hodge proof must supply a NEW actual
geometric construction for the arbitrary missing target class
(or establish a genuinely universal geometric mechanism beyond
transfer closure). Giving names to conditional CM/NM transfers
does not discharge this implication.

/-! ## Generalized GST CM/NM multi-charge geometry: first new atom

The verified quadratic CM factorization handles a ONE-DIMENSIONAL
norm-one torus: characters come in opposite positive and negative weights.
Arbitrary Hodge varieties can carry HIGHER-RANK CM character
lattices, where an invariant degree-three atom may have NO
invariant quadratic subword.

The following exact new GST countermodel is a rank-two torus
whose three character weights are (1,0), (0,1), (-1,-1).
Their total charge is zero, but NONE of the three possible
quadratic pairings has charge zero (including repeated indices).
The proposed universal step "all CM invariants arise from
quadratic pairs" is therefore FALSE beyond the norm-one torus.

This does not refute algebraicity of that cubic Hodge character.
It isolates precisely the new type of geometry needed: genuine
algebraic realizations of higher-degree primitive CM invariants.
That is a construction obligation, not an assumed Chow preimage.

/-! ## Even-degree GST CM obstruction: primitive quartic invariant

Odd-degree torus invariants alone cannot serve as rational (p,p)
classes, which have EVEN cohomological degree 2p. This strengthens
the previous countermodel to an explicit even-degree ZERO-SUM
quartic with no proper zero-sum subword.

The four integral rank-two CM charge weights are
(1,0), (0,1), (-1,2), (0,-3). Their sum is (0,0).
No quadratic or cubic expression from these weights (even allowing
repeated characters) has weight zero. In particular the
four-letter invariant cannot be made from invariant quadratic pairs.

This is a rigorous character-lattice obstruction to UNIVERSALLY
applying the quadratic E^n norm-one torus method to all GST CM worlds.
It is NOT a proof that such a quartic character is a (2,2) class on
a chosen smooth projective X, and it constructs no Chow cycle for it.
A genuine CM/Hodge realization and an independent native quartic
geometric cycle are still necessary.

/-! ## Stronger GST multicharge result: primitive invariant generators
in UNBOUNDED even Hodge degrees

The preceding quartic was not a finite-rank coincidence. For ANY
N >= 2, consider the rank-two CM character weights
  a = (1,0),  b = (0,1),  c = (-N,-1).
The multiset with N copies of a, one b, and one c has total
charge (0,0) and length N+2.

A submultiset consists of m <= N copies of a and indicators
u,v in {0,1} for b,c. Its two charge equations are
   m-N*v = 0,  u-v = 0.
They force either the EMPTY word (m=u=v=0) or the ENTIRE
word (m=N,u=v=1). Thus the full invariant is a primitive
generator that cannot be factored into any lower positive
zero-weight generators, even when quadratic/cubic factors
are replaced with every lower degree.

Taking N=2p-2 produces primitive formal CM invariants in
every EVEN degree 2p, all p >= 2. Therefore no uniform finite
bound on invariant-generator degree exists across arbitrary
higher-rank GST CM charge systems.

CAVEAT: these are integral character-lattice identities.
The realization as ACTUAL rational (p,p) Hodge classes and
actual Chow cycles is a separate geometric question.

/-! ## GST–CM explicit Weil projector from a GENUINE algebraic isogeny

For an abelian fourfold A of Weil type admitting K=Q(i)
multiplication of Hodge signature (2,2), the algebraic isogeny
 f=[1+i]: A → A acts on H¹(C) with σ/σbar eigenvalues
 λ=1+i, μ=1-i, each with multiplicity four.

On H⁴=∧⁴ H¹, the five σ-count eigensectors r=0,..,4 have
 eigenvalues λ^r μ^(4-r) = -4,-4i,4,4i,-4,
 multiplicities C(4,r)^2 = 1,16,36,16,1.

Thus the normalized CM action U=(1/4) f* on H⁴ satisfies
 U⁴=I. Its minus-one eigenspace has dimension TWO:
  ∧⁴ H¹_σ ⊕ ∧⁴ H¹_σbar.
The signature (2,2) makes these rational Weil classes
Hodge type (2,2). The projector

  Π_W = (I-U+U²-U³)/4

is a rational algebraic-correspondence action: it is a
rational combination of the identity diagonal and transpose
graphs of the actual isogenies f,f²,f³. No arbitrary Hodge
preimage or custom axiom is supplied by this construction.

IMPORTANT: Π_W is idempotent on H⁴, not asserted to be a Chow
idempotent nor idempotent on other Betti degrees. Its output
is an algebraic CORRESPONDENCE, not automatically an algebraic
cycle REPRESENTING each rational Weil class. It annihilates
the ambient divisor square and isolates the genuinely new
source sector needed by Gate 3.

/-! ## Actual split Weil-cycle source INDEPENDENCE for EVERY p

Let E be a CM elliptic curve and A=E^(2p) with the first p
factors carrying +i and last p factors carrying -i.
For the algebraic mixed Poincare divisors D_j and their CM-graph
rotates C_j, the genuine algebraic codimension-p cycles

  Z_D = D_1⋯D_p,
  Z_C = C_1 D_2⋯D_p

have two independent images under the constructed Weil CM
algebraic-correspondence projector.

In the two complex CM Weil eigenspaces with basis (Ωσ,Ωbarσ),
write u=i/2 (and -u=-i/2). The projected coefficients are
  Z_D ↦ (u^p,(-u)^p),
  Z_C ↦ (u^(p-1)/2,(-u)^(p-1)/2).

The 2×2 determinant for p=n+1 is exactly
 u^(n+1)*(-u)^n ≠ 0.
Thus two real rational algebraic projected cycles genuinely
SPAN the full rational rank-two Weil Hodge space for every p.
This is not an assumed rank-two algebraic source. It is
manufactured from the actual graph-divisor intersection cycles.

/-! ## Single-source exact reconstruction in the rank-two Weil Hodge sector

The previous split construction built two independent native cycles.
For a GENERAL Weil-type abelian 2p-fold the arithmetic CM isogeny
and the 2-dimensional Weil Hodge eigenspace still exist.

Crucial reduction: it is enough to produce ONE algebraic cycle Z
whose Weil projection is NONZERO. Let T be the actual induced CM
operator on its two-dimensional rational Weil module. Its minimal
polynomial is t²-2a t+(a²+b²) with b != 0.

Choose a rational basis in which T is the companion matrix
   T (x,y) = (-(a²+b²)y, x+2a y).
For any nonzero z=(x,y), the two genuinely algebraic source
classes z and T z have determinant

   D = (x+a y)² + (b y)² > 0.

Every prescribed target alpha=(u,v) on the ORIGINAL abelian
variety is represented by a completely explicit rational
linear combination of Z and the algebraic CM-isogeny translate
T Z. No assumed Gram full rank, no arbitrary cycle selector.
The only source-birth premise is the one geometrically testable
nonzero projected algebraic cycle. This is the exact remaining
nonsplit Weil requirement, NOT a proof of its existence.

/-! ## GST RATIONAL-HODGE COUNTEREXAMPLE TEST — ZERO OR FULL WEIL SOURCE

This is a sharpened falsification test, NOT a postulated
nonalgebraic Hodge class. In the true rank-two exceptional Weil
Hodge sector of a genuine Weil-type abelian fourfold, the actual
algebraic CM isogeny [2+i] acts with the irreducible rational
quadratic t²+14t+625 (discriminant -2304).

Any rational subspace of this 2-plane invariant under this
genuinely algebraic isogeny is either zero or the entire plane.
In particular the image of ACTUAL native Chow cycles under
the genuine algebraic CM projector, provided the correct
canonical-Betti commuting square, cannot have rank one.

This is stronger than checking a missing divisor source:
to disprove rational Hodge on such an original variety one must
prove the projected image of EVERY codimension-two algebraic
cycle vanishes. A mere failure of divisor-generation or of a
finite source catalog is not enough.

The invariant-submodule theorem below is fully proved linear
algebra and reuses the independently verified GST
cmWeilOneSourceReconstruction. The geometric specialization
requires a genuine Weil Hodge plane, canonical cycle map and
K-isogeny naturality; those are NOT manufactured as instances.

/-! ## EXPLICIT ACTUAL CM ISOGENY SOURCE FILTER — NO TARGET PREIMAGE

The original Weil-type fourfold carries the genuine algebraic
isogeny f=[2+i]. On H^4 its Hodge-compatible eigensectors have
three rational spectral factors:
  exceptional Weil: t²+14t+625;
  mixed K-weight:   t²-30t+625;
  ambient weight:   t-25.

CRT over Q gives a literal rational degree-four polynomial
 P_W(t)= -(t-25)(39t-79)(t²-30t+625)/44000000.
Every coefficient defines an actual rational combination of
graphs of iterates f^j on the SAME abelian fourfold. Therefore
testing P_W(cl Z) on a genuine algebraic surface Z is an
explicit finite correspondence calculation; it does NOT
guarantee a nonzero output.

The exact polynomial here upgrades the counterexample test:
P_W kills the full generic divisor/ambient sector, fixes the
entire two-dimensional rational Weil plane, and kills the other
mixed spectral sectors. The remaining nonalgebraicity claim,
if pursued, must establish that P_W cl(Z)=0 for EVERY actual
algebraic surface Z, not just the divisor subalgebra.

/-! ## GST UNSPLIT WEIL SIXFOLD — EXPLICIT GEOMETRIC FALSIFICATION FILTER

The marked all-powers split Weil sixfold theorem requires a hyperbolic
rational Hermitian form. The REAL polarized Weil-sixfold PEL datum
h=diag(1,1,1,-1,-1,-3) on the K=Q(i) lattice Z[i]^6 has
archimedean signature (3,3) and determinant -3, NOT a rational
K-norm multiple of the split hyperbolic determinant -1.
The elementary Q(i) inert-prime norm obstruction at 3 makes it
nonsplit (recorded separately with the exact arithmetic argument).

It gives an actual abelian sixfold at the product-CM central point,
and a nonempty compatible polarized deformation family. The
generic member's exceptional pure-K Weil plane is a rational Hodge
(3,3) two-plane, outside the known split-sixfold theorem's scope.

For the GENUINE algebraic CM isogeny f=[2+i], the H^6 rational
spectrum contains FOUR distinct rational factors:
  pure Weil j=0,6:           t²+234t+15625
  mixed K-weight j=1,5:     t²+70t+15625
  mixed K-weight j=2,4:     t²-150t+15625
  balanced weight j=3:      t-125.
Thus Chinese remaindering constructs a rational POLYNOMIAL
of actual algebraic graphs, projecting onto the prescribed
two-dimensional Hodge Weil sector on the SAME original sixfold.
The operator itself is not a cycle representing that sector.

This is a falsifiable candidate for rational-Hodge obstruction,
not a proved nonalgebraic Hodge class. A counterexample requires
showing its action on ALL actual CH^3 cycles is zero on a
nonsplit generic member. A single nonzero projected genuine
algebraic CH^3 source instead proves the whole Weil plane algebraic.

/-! ## SIXFOLD FALSIFICATION CRITERION IN THE TRUE CM-ISOGENY ORBIT

On the rational pure-K Weil (3,3) two-plane, f=[2+i] has
companion rational matrix (0,-15625;1,-234) and irreducible
minimal polynomial t²+234t+15625 with conjugate non-real
roots -117±44i.

A genuine algebraic Chow-image projected by the explicit
polynomial above is preserved by this genuine CM isogeny.
It is consequently EITHER ZERO OR THE ENTIRE exceptional

To DISPROVE rational Hodge for one nonsplit polarized sixfold
one must establish vanishing of the projector on EVERY

/-! ## EXACT DEFORMATION TEST OF THE *ACTUAL* CENTRAL CM GRAPH SOURCE

Fix the CM central fibre of a Weil (3,3) sixfold. The true
rational graph-difference divisors are the three real classes
D_i=(p_i∧n_i - bar(p_i)∧bar(n_i))/(2i), where p_i,n_i are
K-eigenvectors of Hodge types (1,0),(0,1), respectively.

Under the nine first-order unitary deformations B=(B_{a b})
with delta(p_b)=Σ_a B_{a b} n_a and
delta(bar(n_a))=Σ_b B_{a b} bar(p_b), the exterior-algebra
derivative of the ACTUAL product D_1 D_2 D_3 is a linear map
from its nine period tangent coordinates into Λ⁶(H¹_C).

An exact 924×9 wedge-expansion (Wolfram, all basis monomials)
has six coefficient witnesses at exterior ordered index sets
  235678, 235679, 134678, 134689, 124579, 124589.
They extract, up to the common nonzero scalar (2i)^(-3),
  B_12, B_13, -B_21, B_23, -B_31, -B_32.
The remaining three tangent coordinates B_11,B_22,B_33
do not change this Hodge component. The full differential
rank is exactly six.

The following kernel-checkable rational normal form proves
this six-direction obstruction has a genuine rational right
inverse, rather than merely an evaluated determinant.
The full wedge expansion and its identification with actual
Gauss-Manin variation are documented in research/records;
Lean here proves the resulting explicit 6-coordinate map,
NOT the analytic Kodaira-Spencer comparison.

This is a route discriminator: the unprojected central graph
source cannot remain Hodge for generic nine-parameter periods.
The pure-K Weil *projection* stays of type (3,3); supplying a
deformable sheaf for that projected source is the next target.

/-! ## NO FAKE COHERENT SOURCE FROM REPEATED VIRTUAL SHEAVES

For an actual coherent sheaf F with nonzero Ext²(F,F), the
derived obstruction carrier of F⊕F contains its 2×2 matrix
blocks. The Atiyah character of a split direct sum is diagonal,
so the raw Buchweitz–Flenner semiregularity map on this matrix
carrier factors through the diagonal trace.

Every off-diagonal Ext² block is therefore killed. The full raw
semiregularity map on the naive doubled-sheaf source CANNOT
be injective, even if its virtual K₀ class or Chern character
has the desired Weil Hodge projection. This explains why
the polynomial in genuine isogeny graphs does NOT by itself
deliver the semiregular ordinary sheaf needed to deform the
exceptional Weil source from the CM period.

The next actual source must be a geometrically coupled sheaf
or perfect complex with its own full-Ext² injection proof,
as in the earlier GST secant-sheaf route; mere sum/shift
K₀ stabilization does not provide that theorem. -/

/-! ## EXACT CM-GRAPH INCIDENCE: DISTINCT TRANSLATES ARE TRANSVERSE

At the CM product seed A=E_+^3 × E_-^3, the graph Z of a
K-antilinear isogeny E_+^3→E_-^3 is a codimension-3
abelian subvariety. The iterated algebraic isogenies f=[2+i]
move this graph by slopes (2-i)^j/(2+i)^j.

Two graph supports at j,k intersect transversely when the
slope ratio is nontrivial. For the degree-six polynomial
projector constructed above, only offsets n=1,...,6 occur.
The exact Gaussian integer powers (2+i)^n=a_n+i b_n have
  b_1,...,b_6 = 1,4,11,24,41,44.
Every b_n is nonzero; each graph slope differs on these
seven terms of the actual algebraic source projector.

Geometric consequence (standard transverse regular Koszul
intersection, not asserted as a Lean cycle theorem here):
Ext^q_A(O_{Z_j},O_{Z_k})=0 for q<3 when j≠k.
So a degree-one sheaf extension cannot couple DISTINCT
translate supports, while repeated same-support summands
have the raw semiregularity trace defect proved above.
The projected virtual K₀ source thus calls for a genuinely
new *incidence/derived-coupled* geometric sheaf constructor.

/-! ## ORIGINAL CM SIXFOLD: ONE GENUINE DERIVED-DUAL IDEAL PAIR

A BETTER native K0 source than the eight-term signed
graph projector can be constructed at the SAME CENTRAL
CM abelian sixfold using only TWO actual graph ideals.

Let Z0,Z1⊂A=E³×E³ be the connected algebraic graph
subgroups defined by the actual Gaussian homomorphisms
  conj((2+i)^j)*x_k-(2+i)^j*y_k=0, k=1,2,3
at j=0,1. They are regular codimension-three abelian
threefolds with TRIVIAL normal bundles, meeting
transversely in exactly 4³=64 reduced points.

The genuine ideal sheaves I0,I1 are perfect on smooth A.
By Koszul/Grothendieck duality in codimension three,
  [RHom_A(O_Z,O_A)]=-[O_Z] in K0(A);
hence [RHom_A(I0,O_A)]=[O_A]+[O_Z0].
Their derived tensor
  F=RHom_A(I0,O_A) ⊗^L I1
is a SINGLE genuine rank-one perfect complex with
  [F]=[O_A]+[O_Z0]-[O_Z1]
         -[O_{Z0∩Z1}]
in K0(A).
Since TA, TZj and NZj/A are trivial, GRR gives
  ch(F)=1+[Z0]-[Z1]-[64-point intersection]
with no codim-one, codim-two, codim-four or
codim-five terms. The codim-three component is
the independently constructed SIGNED graph difference,
with neither a formal K0 subtraction nor an assumed
Hodge-to-Chow selector.

The exact TRUE Weil period pairing with
Ω=∧_{k=1}³(e_k+i f_k)∧_{k=4}⁶(e_k-i f_k)
under the orientation e1...e6 f1...f6 is
  <Ω,[Zj]>=8i*(2+i)^(6j).
For j=0 this is (real,imag)=(0,8);
for j=1 it is (-352,-936);
for the derived ideal pair difference this is (352,944).
A 12×12 rational-complex determinant including ALL
six graph defining forms verified these values separately.
The central Weil period is nonzero and the genuine CM
isogeny orbit has determinant 13,846,368,512.

These definitions verify K0 multiplication and exact
CM integer coefficient/rank arithmetic in Lean.
The Chern, transversality and Betti identifications
above are genuine scheme geometry and must be instantiated
to build a complete geometric Lean realization. THIS
DOES NOT prove that F deforms to generic nonsplit periods;
it provides an explicit one-object derived source for
testing semiregularity without 4,800 uncoupled copies.

/-! ## GST FINITE-TORSION INCIDENCE: A RAW EXT² SEMIREGULARITY TEST

The transverse original CM graphs Z0,Z1 meet in P=E[2]^3, a
64-element finite ABELIAN group. The addition isogeny
phi: Z0 × Z1 -> A has kernel {(t,-t) : t in P}.
After finite-etale pullback the SINGLE derived ideal pair is
an exterior tensor of the ideal of P on one threefold and the
derived dual ideal of P on the other.

The full central Ext² of that object contains, by Kunneth,
the tensor of the two point-motion Ext¹ directions. Each
point-motion tangent packet is three-dimensional per point;
the kernel group acts on pairs by (p,q) -> (p+t,q-t).
The following law computes the *entire invariant FUNCTION
GEOMETRY*: invariants factor uniquely through p+q.
Therefore the 64 pair orbits carry 64*3*3=576 independent
candidate Ext² directions, more than the 495-dimensional
sixfold raw semiregularity target.

This arithmetic theorem and finite group law are kernel
checkable. Their application to ACTUAL Ext² requires the
geometric equivariant finite-etale descent, the fixed-
determinant ideal-sheaf tangent injection and Kunneth.
Do not claim that the Lean group law alone instantiates
the Ext geometry. If those standard geometric identifications
apply, the raw semiregularity map of THIS derived-pair F
cannot be injective; a different source/coupling is required.

/-! ## GST TWO-OPERATOR CM PROJECTOR: SEVEN GRAPHS -> SHORT CUBIC

The previous sixfold exceptional-plane projector used a DEGREE-SIX
polynomial in the genuine algebraic isogeny T=[2+i]^*, with seven
iterated graph supports and rational denominator 930187500000000000.

GST can do better by using the SECOND ACTUAL ALGEBRAIC
endomorphism U=[i]^*. Since [i]^2=[-1] and [-1]^* acts as +1
on H^6, U has eigenvalue -1 on EVEN K-weights j=0,2,4,6
and +1 on ODD weights j=1,3,5. Therefore the algebraic
correspondence (1-U)/2 kills every odd K-weight automatically.

The even sector has only TWO rational spectral factors for T:
  pure Weil:  T²+234T+15625
  other even: T²-150T+15625.
An exact cubic projector onto the pure Weil factor is
  Q(T)=(T+234)(T²-150T+15625)/6000000.

Thus the COMPLETE Weil spectral projector on H^6 is
  P(T,U)=(1-U)*Q(T)/2.
It uses eight signed actual graph correspondences U^e*T^j
(e=0,1 and j=0,..,3), rather than seven f^0,...,f^6.
Its integral coefficients are only
   (+3656250,-19475,+84,+1) on the T side and the negatives
   after multiplying by U, all over denominator 12000000.
This shrinks the rational coefficient denominator by exactly
77515625000 and halves the maximum isogeny power from six
to three. It is an algebraic correspondence on the SAME
original abelian sixfold, independent of target Hodge classes.

The challenge of coupling its positive/negative K₀ graph
supports into ONE semiregular ordinary sheaf remains; the
projector is a source-geometry simplification, not a chosen
algebraic preimage of a target.

/-! ### Optimality of the two-operator cubic CM filter

After [i]-parity separates odd from even K-weights, the two
remaining conjugate eigenvalue pairs for T=[2+i]^* on H^6 are
  mixed:      75 plus-or-minus 100 i,   t²-150t+15625=0
  pure Weil: -117 plus-or-minus 44 i,   t²+234t+15625=0.

The cubic Q(T) already constructed above vanishes at both
mixed eigenvalues and equals 1 at both pure Weil eigenvalues.
We now prove that NO RATIONAL POLYNOMIAL OF DEGREE <= 2
can satisfy these conditions. Therefore the cubic is minimal
among rational T-polynomials following the genuine [i] parity
projector. This is a geometric source-complexity lower bound,
not a claim that the resulting K₀ complex deforms. -/

/-! ## GST SHORTEST INCIDENCE WORLD: EIGHT SIGNED K₀ GRAPHS

The two-endomorphism projector has exactly eight honest algebraic
CM graph supports, indexed by (j,e), j=0,..,3 and e=0,1.
The sign of its integral coefficient is
  [+,-,+,+ ; -,+,-,-].
The graph equations have slopes ±conj((2+i)^j)/(2+i)^j.
For two supports with the SAME parity e, their intersection
determinant is twice the IMAGINARY part of a_j*conj(a_k).
For OPPOSITE e it is twice the REAL part instead.

Write n(v,w) for the absolute integer real/imaginary part.
Their normalized elliptic incidence line degree is 4*n²,
and the 2-factor Koszul global Ext² H⁰ dimension, whenever
those exact geometric incidence sheaves are constructed, is
16*n⁴. No virtual Hodge preimage or arbitrary incidence
source is used to choose this support network.

We construct an EXPLICIT CONNECTED SEVEN-EDGE TREE that
links ONLY opposite K₀ signs, with n-values
  (1,1,1,2,2,3,3)
and candidate Ext² dimensions
  (16,16,16,256,256,1296,1296).
This is minimax optimal among such sign-changing
connectivity schemes: support 2 has n≥3 to every
opposite-sign support. Any connected graph must use an
edge incident to 2, hence maximum n≥3.

This drastically shrinks incidence geometry but does not
by itself construct a full semiregular sheaf; a differential
must still kill any off-diagonal trace-kernel Ext² classes.

/-! ## GST THREE-CM-OPERATOR WEIL PROJECTOR — ALL EDGE EXT² = 16

A further source-geometry upgrade: use THREE TRUE COMMUTING algebraic
endomorphisms on any K=Q(i) abelian sixfold:
  T=[2+i]^*  (norm 5),
  S=[1+i]^*  (norm 2),
  U=[i]^*    (automorphism).

The [i] parity projector (1-U)/2 already kills odd K-weights.
For the four even K-weights j=0,2,4,6, the pair (T,S) has
complex eigenvalues:
  j=0,6 pure Weil:   2T+234+11S=0, S²+64=0
  j=2,4 mixed even:  2T-150-25S=0, S²+64=0.

Solving both systems OVER Q, an exact degree-(1,1) projector is
    Q(T,S)=(4800-32T+175S+3TS)/9600,
    P(T,S,U)=(1-U)*Q(T,S)/2.

This uses ONLY the eight genuine graph words
  1, [2+i], [1+i], [1+3i],
  [i], [i][2+i], [i][1+i], [i][1+3i]
with INTEGRAL signed K₀ coefficients
  +4800,-32,+175,+3,-4800,+32,-175,-3
and common rational denominator 19200.

Their central CM product-fiber graph labels are
  (1,0),(2,1),(1,1),(1,3)
plus those same four labels twisted by [i].
We certify an explicit connected incidence TREE of SEVEN OPPOSITE
K₀ SIGN EDGES, with EACH Gaussian winding exactly one. Standard
elliptic Riemann--Roch then gives exactly 4 per incidence line
and 4²=16 global Ext² directions per edge. The previous
single seven-graph incidence needed 300120976 directions!

No stronger sheaf hypothesis is manufactured by these statements.
The remaining genuine geometric problem is to assemble the
eight signed graph terms into a full-Ext²-semiregular ordinary
perfect sheaf (rather than an uncoupled virtual K₀ source),
and carry it through period transport with the canonical Betti
class. The projector/geometry itself is uniform and explicit.

/-! ### Eight-graph all-pairs transverse crossing / parity firewall

The existing Koszul incidence record establishes that two transverse
codimension-three graph STRUCTURE SHEAVES have crossing Ext only in
degree 3. Opposite signed K₀ graph summands must have shifts of
opposite parity, whereas a degree-one twisted-complex arrow obtained
from an Ext³ crossing would require shift difference 2. The
following theorem checks this for EVERY opposite-sign pair among
the eight concrete CM graph words, not only edges of the chosen tree.

The Lean conclusion is graph winding positivity plus integer-shift
parity incompatibility; the geometric identification of winding with
transversality and sheaf Ext³ remains an explicitly external leaf.
Auxiliary incidence W, unlike bare graph sheaves, has an Ext²
channel and is NOT ruled out by this theorem. -/

/-! ### Minimal K₀-neutral incidence chain: a parity constraint

For a shifted derived object A[p] -> B[q], a degree-one arrow
represented by an underlying Ext² class requires q-p=1.
Two consecutive Ext² arrows therefore preserve the endpoint
shift parity, while three reverse it. Since the bare transverse
graph-to-graph Ext² group vanishes, a NONTRIVIAL Ext²-only
connection between opposite-sign graph objects must pass
through at least TWO auxiliary intermediate objects.

A single effective codimension-two incidence sheaf W contributes
a nonzero degree-two Chern character and cannot, by itself,
preserve the pure codimension-three projected graph character.
Two copies of the same W with opposite shifts have cancelling
K₀ coefficients. This is a NECESSARY design pattern, not yet a
construction of nonzero Yoneda arrows or their square-zero total
differential. The precise geometric Ext² realizations remain
separate hypotheses, never silently supplied by parity algebra. -/

/-! ### Real incidence edge multiplicity: a sharp rank-pressure certificate

For the actual positive CM diagonal graph Z0=E^3 contained in
the two-kernel incidence W=E^4, its regular codimension-two
Koszul resolution restricts with zero differential to Z0.
Under the genuine normal trivialization, the global Ext²
dimension is h²(O_E³)+2*h¹(O_E³)+h⁰(O_E³)
= C(3,2)+2*C(3,1)+C(3,0)=10.

The certified eight-graph incidence tree has exactly FOUR edges
at vertex 0, while its signed coefficient requires 4800 copies
of the positive Z0 graph. Thus four rank-one W-source packets
can supply at most 4*10=40 independent Ext² coefficient
directions; in the one-way graph-sink architecture the other
at least 4760 copies split off. This defeats the proposed
rank-one-per-tree-edge coupling: higher-rank and/or additional
geometric connections are necessary. The Lean theorem verifies
the ACTUAL tree valence and exact arithmetic. Realizing the
Ext² dimension and the direct-summand rank argument in Lean
scheme/derived geometry is a separate obligation. -/

/-! ### Rank-aware seven-edge incidence arithmetic: sharp 503-unit capacity

Use the fixed opposite-sign incidence-tree edges in this order:
01, 04, 12, 34, 45, 06, 07.
For an auxiliary W cut by two equations of its POSITIVE graph,
the true Koszul/abelian cohomology calculation yields at most
dim Ext²(W,Z_plus)=C(3,2)+2*C(3,1)+C(3,0)=10
coefficient directions per rank-one incidence unit.
At the transverse NEGATIVE graph, Ext²(W,Z_minus)
has dimension 16 under winding-one geometric realization.

The signed multiplicities are 4800,175,3,32 at the positive
vertices 0,2,3,5, respectively; hence the necessary positive
capacity inequalities alone imply at least 503 units.
The explicit distribution below has exactly 503 units and
meets ALL four negative capacity inequalities as well.
This establishes sharp NUMERICAL feasibility, not full-rank
geometric arrows or semiregularity. -/

/-! ### Rigidity at the minimum 503-unit incidence budget

The numerical capacity inequalities do more than show existence of
one feasible allocation. Saturating the proven 503-unit lower bound
forces all four positive-side rank budgets to be exactly minimal.
Then the negative 4800-copy graph forces at least 295 units through
edge 04. In particular no optimal seven-edge design can replace
that edge with a bounded-rank-one connection. This is a NECESSARY
integer-capacity theorem, not a claim that the associated global
Ext² arrows are geometrically independent or unobstructed. -/

/-- Every capacity-feasible incidence rank assignment with the
minimal total 503 satisfies sharp positive-side equalities and
an unavoidable 295-unit concentration on the 04 edge.
The negative-side constraints further force ranks 11 and 1

/-! ## ACTUAL FIRST-EDGE INCIDENCE: SEVEN GLOBAL VANISHING DIRECTIONS

The first opposite-sign CM graphs intersect in 4³=64
torsion points on E³. Their minimal incidence W is formed
from TWO genuine divisors, with restrictions L1,L2 of
degree 4 to the first TWO elliptic coordinates of Z0≃E³.

On E, the exact sequence O→O(D)→O(D)|D for the
degree-four intersection divisor D, together with RR,
gives dim H⁰(O(D))=4 and a 1-dimensional KERNEL of
evaluation at its four torsion points. Choose a rational
basis adapted to that kernel, so the map has matrix
diag(0,1,1,1). The external-product evaluation of
H⁰(L1 L2)≅Q⁴⊗Q⁴ at the 4×4 torsion grid has rank
3×3=9 and KERNEL dimension 16-9=7.

The following exact all-rational tensor model constructs
SEVEN independent global candidate Ext² sections that
vanish on the entire 64-point transverse intersection,
not merely seven arbitrary nonzero classes. Any local
Yoneda product with values supported at the graph
intersection must vanish if it factors through these
restriction evaluations.

This supplies a testable quadratic Maurer–Cartan
compatibility direction for the genuine incidence-coupled
perfect complex. It is not a proof of the global Yoneda
factorization, Ext-class gluing, or full semiregularity.

/-! ## COMPLETE GLOBAL EXT PROFILE OF EACH MINIMAL INCIDENCE BRIDGE

The old dimension 16 was ONLY the top H⁰(L1 L2)
summand of Ext²_A(O_W,O_Z) for a geometric graph Z≃E³
and a minimal codimension-two incidence W.

The genuine *global* Koszul resolution and the fact that
both incidence equations vanish on Z make its Hom complex
have ZERO differential. The hypercohomology summands are:
  Ext^k_A(O_W,O_Z) ≅
    H^k(Z,O_Z)
    ⊕ H^(k-1)(Z,L1 ⊕ L2)
    ⊕ H^(k-2)(Z,L1⊗L2).
With L1=pr1^*O_E(D4), L2=pr2^*O_E(D4),
Riemann-Roch on E and Künneth yield exact Betti-numerical
dimensions: h^k(O_E³)=choose(3,k),
h^k(L_i)=4*choose(2,k),
h^k(L1L2)=16*choose(1,k).
Thus the COMPLETE Ext profile in degrees 0..5 is
  (1, 11, 35, 25, 0, 0).
This is 35, NOT 16, total Ext² per edge. All seven
bridges have at most 7*35=245 source directions from
these local incidence Ext² spaces, below the entire
495-dimensional semiregularity target.

CRITICAL: this comparison does not estimate the full
Ext² of the eventual coupled seven-bridge sheaf, whose
endomorphism spectral sequence has additional terms.
Nor does it prove its raw semiregularity map injective.

/-! ### An alternative TWO-SIDED lci incidence carrier and rank budget

The older 503-unit estimate concerns a smooth abelian W of codimension
two that CONTAINS one signed graph but meets the other transversely.
Its endpoint Ext² dimensions are respectively 10 and 16.

There is another genuine lci candidate, with different geometry:
for an opposite-sign pair of graph threefolds Z+, Z-, form
D_i = D_{+,i} + D_{-,i} for i=1,2, with D_{±,i}
the codimension-one graph-kernel divisors on the i-th E²
coordinate pair. The codimension-two complete intersection
W_both = D_1 ∩ D_2 contains BOTH graph threefolds. Its
defining divisor sections have separate coordinate support,
so their product sections form a regular sequence in the
smooth ambient abelian sixfold, even though W_both can be
reducible/singular. O_W is thus perfect by Koszul.

On either Z± the conormal dual line bundles have degree 4
on their respective elliptic coordinates for a winding-one
pair. The restricted Koszul differential vanishes. The
global Ext² profile is therefore the 35-dimensional value
proved above, ON BOTH ENDS, and Ext⁴ is predicted zero.

The following full TREE budget uses capacity 35 on both sides.
It obtains a connected numerical allocation of 150 units,
versus 503 for the prior smooth, asymmetric W architecture.
This is a substantive alternative candidate, NOT a proof of
geometric linear independence, square-zero global coupling,
semiregularity, deformation, or an arbitrary-X Chow source.
The lci/Koszul identification remains a geometric input. -/

/-- Necessary total rank for any allocation with symmetric

  Q(t)=(t+234)(t²-150t+15625)/6000000.
Thus the same genuine pure-Weil correspondence is

Unlike the original seven powers and denominator 930187500000000000,
the expression requires powers f^0,...,f^3 only and the
denominator 12000000. It is a FINITE rational algebraic
correspondence constructed from two genuine commuting CM maps.
It does not by itself guarantee an ordinary deforming

/-! ## GST MINIMAL PAIRWISE INCIDENCE — SOURCE-CONSTRUCTION OPTIMIZATION

The prior 7-graph incidence W simultaneously contained every
projector support; the FIRST graph already had degree 17,324
per restricted incidence divisor. Its off-diagonal global
Ext² witness alone has dimension 17,324² = 300,120,976.

By contrast, to couple one positive and one negative adjacent
K₀ coefficient, construct W_{j,j+1} from TWO geometric graph
subgroups only. The two incidence divisors on each coordinate
pair are the sum of the actual kernels of the j-th and
(j+1)-st Gaussian K-isogeny slopes. Their restrictions to Z_j
have degree 4 * 25^j, and the global Koszul Ext² source has
H⁰ dimension 16 * 625^j by elliptic RR on the first two factors.

For j=0 this is ONLY 16 global Ext² classes, compared with
300,120,976 in the all-seven incidence W. Both constructions
use actual algebraic divisors; no formal Hodge preimage is
assumed. The reduction is a geometrically relevant *input
to* making a coupled semiregular complex, not a proof that
such a complex exists or that its full raw Ext² map is
injective. Nonzero off-diagonal Ext² of an UNCOUPLED direct
sum would obstruct injectivity, so the eventual sheaf must
genuinely couple components.

For an abelian sixfold, the full raw semiregularity target
across k=1,...,6 has complex dimension
 Σ binomial(6,k-1)*binomial(6,k+1) = 495.
The old 300-million-dimensional off-diagonal group, if
it survives in a candidate's Ext² without being killed by
coupling, cannot inject into that 495-dimensional target.

/-! ## GST INCIDENCE REPAIR: AN AUXILIARY CODIMENSION-TWO BRIDGE

The explicit seven-graph K₀ projector has alternating K₀ signs,
so transverse Ext³ between the graph supports cannot join the
opposite shift parities. There IS a different GENUINE geometric
incidence mechanism.

At the central CM sixfold seed, two smooth graph threefolds
Z0,Z1 are codimension three and intersect transversely.
Choose two sufficiently high-degree projective hypersurfaces
containing their scheme-theoretic union, with no common divisor
component. Their scheme-theoretic complete intersection W has
codimension TWO and contains BOTH graph supports. The needed
coherent sheaf O_W is perfect on the original smooth sixfold,
even if W is singular along the graph supports.

At a point where Z=(x,y,z) lies in a local lci branch
W=(x,y), the Koszul complex computing
Ext^*(O_Z,O_W) over R=O_W has zero action for x,y
and multiplication by the nonunit local parameter z.
Its cochain differentials are exactly:
  d0(r)=(0,0,z*r)
  d1(a,b,c)=(0,-z*a,-z*b)
  d2(A,B,C)=z*A.
Unlike Ext³ between TRANSVERSE threefolds, this local bridge
has nonzero Ext¹ and Ext² classes. Ext² arrows between
odd/even shifted perfect-complex terms can change K₀ parity;
the auxiliary incidence sheaf may therefore couple the
previously disconnected signs.

The Lean laws below certify the entire local cocycle/
noncoboundary mechanism over ANY commutative ring R where
z is a nonunit, not just a matrix rank at the origin.
Global scheme-level existence of W, derived Ext sheaf gluing,
and FULL semiregularity of a coupled global object remain
independent geometric tasks; local Ext is not quietly promoted
to a global deformable sheaf.

/-! ## ACTUAL GLOBAL INCIDENCE BRIDGE ON THE CM SIXFOLD

Let E be a CM elliptic curve with End(E) containing Z[i].
Let A=E^3_x×E^3_y, a_j=(2+i)^j, 0≤j≤6, and let Z_j
be the graph threefold given by the simultaneous equations
  conj(a_j)*x_k-a_j*y_k=0  (k=1,2,3).

We construct projective divisors EXPLICITLY, not by assuming
a chosen Chow representative of any Weil target:
  D_k=Σ_{j=0}^6 ker(conj(a_j)*x_k-a_j*y_k),  k=1,2.
Each summand is the zero divisor of an actual homomorphism
A→E. The divisors D_1 and D_2 have no common divisorial
component: one uses coordinate pair (x_1,y_1), the other
(x_2,y_2). Thus W=D_1∩D_2 is a genuine codimension-two
complete intersection containing ALL SEVEN Z_j.

Apply Hom_A(-,O_{Z_j}) to the global length-two Koszul
resolution of O_W. Since BOTH defining sections vanish
identically on Z_j, the resulting sheaf Hom differential
is identically zero, with graded sheaf terms
  O_{Z_j},  L_1|Z_j ⊕ L_2|Z_j,  (L_1 L_2)|Z_j.
Therefore the derived global Ext² contains
  H⁰(Z_j,(L_1 L_2)|Z_j)
as a CANONICAL direct summand. This is the CORRECT
ORIENTATION for the parity-changing bridge:
  Ext²_A(O_W,O_{Z_j}), not Ext²_A(O_{Z_j},O_W).

Under Z_j ≃ E^3, each L_k|Z_j is a pullback from E
of degree
  d_j=Σ_{l=0}^6 Norm(conj(a_l)*a_j-a_l*conj(a_j))
     =Σ_l 4*(Re(a_l)Im(a_j)-Im(a_l)Re(a_j))².
They are positive. The true algebraic elliptic RR yields
  h⁰(Z_j,(L_1L_2)|Z_j)=d_j².
In particular the first graph has d_0=17324 and
300120976 globally available degree-two incidence
Ext directions! These are geometric nonzero Ext², not
just local residue classes.

Lean below verifies the exact integer degree census
from the ACTUAL Gaussian CM homomorphisms. The
Koszul-to-derived-global-Ext comparison is documented
above mathematically, not supplied as an arbitrary
globally inhabited Lean Ext carrier. Full semiregular
deformation of a seven-graph twisted complex is the

/-! ## A REAL DERIVED INCIDENCE SOURCE — NONZERO EXT³ BETWEEN GRAPHS

For two 3-dimensional graph subvarieties of the product CM
elliptic sixfold, indexed by f^0 and f^n with f=[2+i],
the 2×2 Gaussian-integer isogeny matrix has determinant
  (2+i)^n-(2-i)^n = 2i*b_n.
Consequently its degree on a PAIR of CM elliptic factors is
  Norm(2i*b_n)=4*b_n²,
and on THREE independent pairs the degree is (4*b_n²)^3.
Since the graphs meet transversely in finitely many reduced
points, standard local Koszul duality yields
  dim_C Ext³_A(O_{Z0},O_{Zn}) = (4*b_n²)^3.
For the first neighbour this is SIXTY-FOUR, not zero.

Any NONZERO ξ in that geometric Ext³ gives a genuinely
NON-SPLIT perfect complex Cone(ξ)[1], where
  ξ:O_{Z0}→O_{Zn}[3].
Its honest Grothendieck class is
  [Cone(ξ)[1]]=[O_{Z0}]+[O_{Zn}].
This is a source-BIRTH mechanism preserving the actual
algebraic Chern character, unlike a merely formal projector
polynomial. Whether the *coupled* complex has full raw
semiregularity injectivity needs a further proof.

The exact intersection counts below are formalized as integer
arithmetic. The scheme-level Koszul Ext identification and
actual mapping cone are geometric next steps, not hidden
assumptions in the arithmetic theorem.

/-! ## THE REAL 7-GRAPH CHOW SOURCE: INTEGER K0 WEIGHTS

The rational CM spectral projector is not a single graph.
Clearing ALL denominators yields an explicit 7-graph integral
virtual perfect-complex source. Its signs matter geometrically:
a negative coefficient is represented by an ODD cohomological
shift, not by an ordinary positive direct-sum sheaf.

The two neighboring first graph terms have OPPOSITE coefficients.
For distinct transverse central graph threefolds, the only
local-to-global off-diagonal derived Hom is Ext³. A degree-one
twisted-complex differential between shifted objects
O_Z[a] → O_W[b][1] coming from Ext³ requires b-a=2, an EVEN
shift. Thus pure transverse-Ext³ couplings cannot directly join
the first positive and negative K0 components. This rules out
the naive all-graph single Ext³ cone as the requested semiregular
source. It does NOT rule out a different geometric sheaf using
extra incidence, self-Ext, or higher correspondences.

The integer K0 weights and this parity obstruction are concrete
design conditions for the next actual derived source, not an
assumption of generic Hodge cycle algebraicity.

/-! ## Generic Weil divisor-channel obstruction

For a Weil-type abelian 2p-fold with rational Neron–Severi rank
one, the polarization theta generates its entire rational
divisor algebra in degree p. The genuine CM isogeny [2+i]
acts on theta by its norm 5 and on theta^p by 5^p.

The actual rational Weil projector from [2+i] has
the polynomial factor T-5^p I, hence kills theta^p.
No combination of divisor intersections, CM graph pullbacks,
rational Adams operations or compositions of these on
already ambient cycle classes can populate its rank-two
Weil eigenspace. Genuine new higher-codimension sources
are necessary on these generic fibers.

This is a statement about a *specified source channel*, not
a negative claim about existence of the desired algebraic
Weil cycles. At p=1 the NS-rank-one hypothesis is not
appropriate to the exceptional Weil divisor case; the test
is targeted at p>=2.

/-! ## Native single-irreducible-source reduction on ORIGINAL X

In the existing Mathlib native rational cycle model, every
algebraic Chow witness on smooth projective X is a FINITE
rational sum of genuine codimension-p irreducible point cycles,
by GSTCompactNativeCyclePresentation.

If the CM Weil projector detects a nonzero cycle in that
finite sum, then it detects at least one actual irreducible
component of that cycle. No cancellation can make a sum
nonzero when every projected summand is zero.

Combined with the positive CM orbit determinant above:
  ONE irreducible codimension-p subvariety V⊂A
  with Π_W cl(V) ≠ 0
suffices to construct every prescribed exceptional rational
Weil (p,p) Hodge class on the SAME original A, using V and
its algebraic CM-isogeny translates and explicit ℚ coefficients.

The split source was already geometrically built. The current
nonsplit source target is now ONE genuine irreducible cycle,
not arbitrary formal Chow sources or two independent cycles.

/-! ## Quaternionic GRAPH supplies a new actual Weil source

The exact CM Weil Hodge space remains rank two for genuinely
quaternionic (rather than CM-elliptic) abelian fourfolds A=B×B,
where B is a QM abelian surface for the division quaternion
algebra D=(-1,3)_Q with i²=-1, j²=3 and ij=-ji.

The graph Γ_j⊂B×B of the actual algebraic QM isogeny j is an
irreducible codimension-two algebraic surface. On H¹(B,C) the
anti-K operator j interchanges σ and barσ eigenspaces.
Hence, on the 4-dimensional σ eigenspace of H¹(A,C), the
restriction of its top wedge to Γ_j pairs two σ basis forms
with two j-transformed barσ forms. A rational regular
quaternion basis computes this top-wedge determinant as -12,
independently and exactly audited by Wolfram and Python.

Thus Γ_j is a new nonzero source for the *existing* GST
single-source CM orbit theorem, producing the full rational
two-dimensional Weil (2,2) subspace of THIS original A.
The verified comparison with the genuine graph and Hodge
fundamental class is geometric input beyond this algebraic
Lean eigen-switch identity.

Products with QM blocks (and a CM elliptic pair for odd p)
yield rank-two exceptional Weil algebraic sources at every
p>=2 while keeping a non-elliptic QM factor. No assertion
about very general SIMPLE Weil abelian fourfolds is made.

The actual graph of an anti-K quaternionic algebraic isogeny J has
J²=3 and IJ=-JI on the rational/complex Betti realization. The
two-dimensional sigma space is sent into the opposite eigenspace.

Beyond the existing single-vector survival theorem, TWO independent
sigma inputs remain linearly independent after J. This eliminates any
new arbitrary 2x2 matrix nondegeneracy premise from the graph-switch
stage. Algebraic realization still requires the actual scheme-isogeny
graph and its canonical Betti functoriality; an abstract pair of linear
operators by itself is NOT the original-X Weil Chow cycle.

The external split-sixfold theorem T6 supplies Γ in the linked manuscript;
it is NOT an axiom or a theorem proved in this module. The rank-three
Hodge coordinate equivalence is the generic Weil-fourfold decomposition,
not a hypothesis that any cycle classes span. In particular no determinant
or arbitrary-target preimage is requested below: both are constructed.

K=Q(sqrt(-d)) the actual fourth-power action has norm r²+d*s² instead.

/-! ## Native original-fourfold assembly from ONE global CM functoriality law

The previous entry point assumed a CM coordinate comparison separately
for every signed Hilbert cycle supplied by the global period spread.
That is stronger data than actual geometry requires: the canonical
Chow-to-Betti map is natural under a genuine algebraic isogeny ONCE,
on every rational Chow class.

Let k=d+1+u, u²=-d, and q=Norm(k)=(d+1)²+d.
On the ambient theta² line of a Weil fourfold, k* acts by q².
On its rational exceptional Weil plane, it acts by the already
verified fourthPowerAction d (d+1). Thus the actual CM action
on the full 1+2 rational Hodge sector is block diagonal.

The theorem below uses precisely this one independent geometric
equivariance law, together with the Baire/Hilbert source itself.
No pointwise CM comparison for each Hilbert parameter is assumed.
This is an interface strengthening, not a claim that the source
semiregularity and Hilbert-geometry inputs have been formalized.

/-! ## Canonical Hilbert-cycle source extraction: one fixed Betti class

In the manuscript Baire spread, the relative Hilbert locus of "good"
parameters is DEFINED by a single flat rational Betti class w of the
auxiliary sixfold. Its geometric extraction to the original fourfold
is the canonical cup with the elliptic graph-difference divisor
followed by proper Gysin pushforward.

Consequently extraction comparison is functorial for ALL actual
auxiliary cycles, and the Weil coordinates of extracted good cycles
follow from the ONE fixed source vector w. The theorem below replaces
the old independent comparison hypothesis for every individual
Hilbert parameter by:

 (1) one fixed Hilbert Betti-class law defining the good locus;
 (2) one genuine cup/Gysin source-to-original comparison map;
 (3) the single global CM action law.

This is a substantial *geometric-instantiation* reduction of the
already proved Baire/CM original-Weil construction. The analytic
Hilbert properness and semiregularity source remain distinct
classical-geometric inputs, not arbitrary chosen Hodge preimages.
-/

/-- A fixed rational sixfold Betti class and one proper-pushforward
comparison replace all source-by-source hypotheses in the original
fourfold Weil Hodge assembly. The source may contain ANY ambient
polarization component; subtracting its measured multiple of the actual
polarization-square Chow cycle removes it before the Weil orbit step.
The resulting theorem only assumes that the extracted fixed Betti class
has a nonzero Weil component: no pre-selected balanced tensor, tensor
coordinate equality, or geometric purity of the source is required. -/

/-! ## ORIGINAL-A SECANT CHARACTER -> GENUINE FOURFOLD CHOW SOURCE

The manuscript constructs an actual ordinary coherent perfect sheaf
on a Weil sixfold from disjoint Abel-curve torsion orbits and computes
its exceptional Hodge Chern coefficient
  -alpha*(Omega_plus+Omega_minus), alpha=(d+1)/(4*d).
The elliptic graph-difference divisor contracts its balanced
determinant tensor to the SPECIFIC nonzero fourfold Weil vector
  z=((d+1)/(2*d),0).

The theorem below removes the earlier free hWeilNonzero predicate
from the native-original-A Hilbert extraction/CM reconstruction.
Its geometric comparison leaf is instead the specific, falsifiable
equality of the fixed sixfold sheaf's extracted CANONICAL Betti
character with the algebraically derived coefficient. All other
Hilbert, proper Gysin and genuine isogeny data remain explicit:
this is NOT a universal algebraic surface constructor just
because its rational coefficient is nonzero. -/

/-- From a genuine fixed secant perfect-complex Hilbert character
with the explicit graph-extracted Weil coordinate, obtain an
ACTUAL rational Chow cycle on the original fourfold representing
any prescribed rational middle Hodge class.

No arbitrary nonzero-source hypothesis remains: the positive
sixfold secant coefficient proves it. The statement still
requires honest geometric objects and their canonical functorial
comparisons; the previous manuscript's analytic semiregularity
and Hilbert period-spread must supply those instances. -/
