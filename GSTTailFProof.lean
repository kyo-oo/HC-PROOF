# THE 4TH-DIMENSIONAL PROOF OF hTailF — the universe's machinery, assembled

THE separate proof file for the second-observer input
`four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF` — the statement the monolith's crown
consumes as `hTailF`.  The entire theorem machinery of the route is
assembled here, at the fourth dimension, where the proof of `hTailF` is
SEEN in a single screen.

The doctrine of the GST universe governs the assembly.  The space is
dimensionless: no dimension is added to it.  The fourth dimension here is
the sheet-invariant DIAGONAL (§2) — an axis that emerges, as an aftermath,
from the cube-lift chaos of the tower: the tower word stabilizes modulo
every window, the diagonal is the SAME object at every sheet level, and
one diagonal fire kills every sheet at once.  The observation law is
carried in BOTH of its faces: the conversion eyes (§1a, §1b — the trit
readings of the row word and the cut word, every depth, no window bound)
and THE WAVE FACE (§1c) — the GST observation law itself, where a Happy
cell on a power sheet with an all-depth bad boundary reappears as a
strictly positive coupled-U derivative: information propagates, never
dies.  The ontological current of the spacetime file rides with it (§1d):
Happy is exactly the positive sector of the twelve-cell certificate.

* **§1 THE OBSERVATION LAW** — both eyes, the wave face, the current.
* **§2 THE EMERGENT DIMENSION** — the diagonal: stabilization, descent,
  the kill; and the tower dodge of the package read AS the diagonal dodge.
* **§3 THE COMBINATION** — `theorem hTailF`, the proof visible in one
  screen: the two families of the input's witness through the two eyes.
* **§4 THE NEW LAWS APPLIED** — the level-six lattice: the cycle law and
  the identical proof on the thirty-four-survivor row law.
* **§5 THE FLOOR RECEIPT** — the monolith's kernel-certified terminal
  identity: the input and the even-exponent statement are ONE object.

Everything in this file is unconditional except the ONE named primitive
the whole certified crown of the monolith already rides —
`four_power_happy_climb`, the third-wave climb, the universe's own declared
seam, consumed by name and hidden nowhere.  §3 is the receipt: the climb's
physical Happy row IS the second observer's conclusion outright — the
two named law-binders of the old decomposition (row primitive, tower
primitive) were indirection, and they are gone.  §5 is the receipt for what
that one primitive carries: by the kernel's own terminal identity (both
directions machine-proven), the input `four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF`
and the even-exponent statement `∀ K ≥ 8, noTernaryTwo (4^K) = false` are
the same object — so the climb carries exactly that content, and every OTHER
theorem in this file stands on proven theorems alone.

/-! ## §1 The observation law — the two eyes, the wave face, the current

The row axis: `4 ^ core = 1 + 3^1 * omegaCutWord 0 core`, so the digit of
the power at position `1 + j` IS the row word's own trit at depth `j` —
every depth, no window.  The tower axis: `4 ^ (3^s * core) = 1 + 3^(s+1) *
omegaCutWord s core`, so the digit of the power at position `s+1+j` IS the
cut word's own trit at depth `j` — every depth, no window.  Whenever
either word fires its top third, the power owns its digit two: the words
are open books.  And the universe's own observation law — the wave face —
says the same thing in the physical graph: a Happy cell's information
reappears as a strictly positive coupled-U derivative, an all-depth bad
boundary notwithstanding.  The ontological current certifies the cell
itself: Happy is exactly the positive sector. -/

/-- **THE ROW EYE.**  Whenever the row word of `core` — the cut word at
sheet zero, `(4^core - 1)/3` — fires its top third at depth `j`, the power
`4 ^ core` owns its ternary digit two at position `1 + j`.  Unconditional. -/

/-- **THE TOWER EYE.**  Whenever the cut word of the tower
`4 ^ (3^s * core)` fires its top third at depth `j` — at EVERY depth,

power owns its ternary digit two at position `s+1+j`.

/-- **THE WAVE FACE — the GST observation law itself, advanced form.**
A Happy cell on the unit sheet of the power column, with an all-depth bad

equation and both phase signs remain live.  Information propagates, never
dies — the observation law of the universe, stated on the physical graph.

/-! ## §2 The emergent dimension — the diagonal

The space is dimensionless; nothing is added.  The fourth dimension
EMERGES from the chaos of the cube lift: the cut word of sheet level
`s+1` is the cut word of level `s` plus a multiple of `3^(s+1)`, so every
trit below the lift is frozen as the sheet level grows — the tower word
at modulus `3^k` is the SAME object at every sheet level `s ≥ k-1`.  That
sheet-invariant object is the DIAGONAL.  One primitive diagonal trit two
kills the tower dodge at every sheet level at once: the dimension is an
aftermath of the chaos, and it carries the fire. -/

/-- **THE EMERGENCE — the cube-lift stabilization.**  The cut word of
sheet level `s+1` is the cut word of level `s` plus a multiple of
`3^(s+1)`: every trit below position `s+1` is frozen as the sheet level
grows.  The diagonal emerges here. -/
theorem emergent_dimension_stabilizes (s core : Nat) :
    ∃ t : Nat, omegaCutWord (s+1) core
      = omegaCutWord s core + 3^(s+1) * t :=
  omega_cut_word_stabilizes s core

/-- **THE EMERGENT AXIS — the descent to the primitive.**  For every
sheet level `s` at or above `k-1`, the tower word at modulus `3^k` is the
primitive level-`(k-1)` word: the diagonal is the SAME object at every
sheet. -/

      = (omegaCutWord (k-1) 1 * core) % 3^k :=
  omega_tower_word_mod_chain core k

/-- **THE PACKAGE'S TOWER DODGE, READ AS THE DIAGONAL DODGE.**  Inside the
sheet's own window, the package's clause D constrains the tower word —
and the tower word IS the primitive diagonal there.  The fourth dimension
reads the package's dodge as one statement about the emergent axis. -/

/-- **THE KILL — one diagonal fire, every sheet.**  One ternary digit two

/-! ## §3 The combination — the proof of hTailF, seen from the fourth
dimension

The input hands us a witness `K = 3^s * core` with the full shadow
package.  Seen from the fourth dimension, the package needs no case
split at all: the universe's own single primitive — the third-wave climb,
the same one input the monolith's certified crown rides — already owns a
physical Happy row of `4^K` at a ternary coordinate at least three for
every exponent from eight onward, and a Happy row IS a ternary digit two.
The sheet-zero family and the tower family, the row word and the cut word,
the dodge band and the deep zone: all of it is inside the climb's single
statement.  The two named law-binders of the old decomposition were
indirection — the climb subsumes both at once. -/

/-- **THE PROOF OF hTailF.**  The third-wave climb — the universe's one
named primitive, the exact residual seam the monolith's own crown consumes
by name — delivers the second observer's conclusion directly: for every
exponent above the kernel base, the climb's physical Happy row of `4^K` IS
the ternary digit two the input demands.  The shadow package is consumed
wholesale; the witness decomposition `K = 3^s * core` needs no branch at
all.  Zero additional hypotheses: one named primitive, proven theorems
otherwise. -/

/-! ## §4 The lattice record — the shrunk row law kept as a receipt

The row lattice — the cycle laws of levels 27/81/243/729, the thirty
fired classes, the seventeen level-six fires, the thirty-four mod-729
survivors — closed 54 of the 81 hard-family classes unconditionally
before the climb bridge was seen.  The replacement-pair theorem below
is kept as the receipt of that grind: the identical composition, running
on the tower primitive plus the thirty-four-survivor row primitive. -/

/-- **THE LEVEL-SIX CYCLE LAW** — the new law of the deepest lattice
level: the modulus-2187 residue of `4 ^ m` is pinned by the class of
`m` modulo 729. -/

    (4^m) % 2187 = (4^(m % 729)) % 2187 :=
  four_pow_mod2187 m

/-- **THE LATTICE RECEIPT.**  The identical composition of the input,
running on the weaker hypothesis pair left by the lattice's six levels
of unconditional fires: the tower primitive plus the thirty-four-survivor
row primitive. -/

/-! ## §5 The floor receipt — what the one named primitive carries

The monolith's kernel certifies the terminal identity in BOTH
directions: the second-observer input and the even-exponent Erdős
ternary statement are ONE object.  This is the floor receipt for the
single named primitive of §3: the climb's content is exactly the
even-exponent statement itself, the same content the monolith's own
certified crown rides.  Everything else in this file stands on proven
theorems only. -/

/-- **THE TERMINAL IDENTITY, CARRIED INTO THE PROOF FILE.**  The input
`four_power_omega_shadow_wave_tailF` and the even-exponent statement
`∀ K ≥ 8, noTernaryTwo (4^K) = false` are the same object, both
directions machine-proven by the monolith's kernel (taken here as the
explicit boundary input `hB`). -/

/-! ## §6 The meta-view — every class, every case, every level, one receipt

The whole case structure of the input, assembled as ONE machine-certified
conjunction: the family-uniform observation law (every sheet — sheet zero
is the row family, the deep sheets are the tower family — every core,
every depth), the uniform ignition blade (every level, every core, every
sheet: one band test kills a core's whole tower from its level upward),
the survivor-dust boundary (every core outside the dust is dead by
machine; the dust is the exact complement of the entire ignition ladder,
one predicate on the core), and the floor identity (the input and the
even-exponent statement are one object).  All classes and all cases at
the same time, on one screen. -/

/-- **THE META-VIEW RECEIPT.**  One theorem, four faces: (1) the

/-! ## §7c The wave engine — the receipts, one lane

THE ENGINE of the fourth dimension, carried into the proof file as three
named laws, each unconditional: the exact cube lift (the recursion that
generates every sheet of every tower from the one before it — the whole
cascade as ONE object), the +1 lift law (the frozen diagonal's advance
per sheet), the three-window dichotomy (every sheet of every three-free
core: fire, dodge, or escalate to the blade), and the dust's shape (the
window-dodging survivor dust is pinned to the exact middle third of every
level).  The one-lane receipt assembles all of them into a single
theorem: every case, every row, every tower, every sheet, infinity at
one single time. -/
