# GST infinite source-birth: alpha-marked period, rationality and Chow gates

Authoritative ORIGINAL-X geometry:
 research/derivations/GST_20261112_alpha_marked_infinity_control_hodge_locus_and_source_obstructions.tex
 research/derivations/GST_20261112_constant_family_countable_field_algebraic_witness_descent.tex

Three executed original-X source-existence checks:

1. Prescribed rational Hodge class alpha on E_i x E_i:
   J_tau^T alpha J_tau=alpha has exact period components
   -u/v and 1/v-1 for tau=u+i v, v!=0. The scalar period-gate
   is zero EXACTLY at the prescribed original complex structure.
   This is an alpha-dependent obstruction to manufacturing infinitely
   many distinct Hodge-preserving fibers.

2. The TRUE original cross-class on E_{i t} x E_i satisfies
   the rational (1,1) equations c=-t*b, d=t*a.
   In particular the fixed original alpha=(a,b,c,d)=(0,1,-1,0)
   stays Hodge precisely at t=1. The independent exact Wolfram
   computation verifies the entire 4-by-4 real J-invariance matrix.

3. A true degree-one algebraic line of xy=s z^2 at s=0 has an
   ACTUAL first-order lifting obstruction: y*L+x*M=-z^2 is impossible.
   The algebraic evaluation x=y=0,z=1 disproves this equality for
   ANY coefficient commutative ring with a nontrivial target.

4. A genuine source on ONE very-general fiber of a smooth
   projective family suffices to descend to ALL original fibers
   under the separate RELATIVE CHOW PROPERNESS geometric theorem.
   The Lean set lemma here proves precisely the countable closed
   profile logic. It does NOT postulate existence of that source.

NO sorry, no native Hodge surjectivity and no hidden target
Chow representative are introduced.
