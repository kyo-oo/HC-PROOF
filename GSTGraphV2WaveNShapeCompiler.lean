# GST N-hole wave fold: actual channel-dependent single operator

The original dimensionless 12-cell information graph and CM/Wave-I
operator T are applied independently to every genuine Wave-II N-hole
channel, while a channel-specific *rational spectral address* separates
different channels.

For an actual GST NShape s, channel injectivity is a theorem of
GSTNCohomology. Define the one proposed wave operator

  (T_s f)(i) := T(f(i)) + (10*channel(i))*f(i).

The scalar 10 is chosen from a proved row-absolute-sum bound 4 for the
12-state operator. Distinct channel positions give disjoint spectral
disks and hence coprime shifted characteristic polynomials. Combined
with the exact full 12x12 Krylov determinant, polynomial CRT proves in
the mathematical derivation that the uniform seed is cyclic on all
12*s.holes rational signal coordinates (including arbitrary large n).

This module formalizes the exact indexed fold, the injective spectral
addresses, and the morphism from independent Wave-II hole signals.
The all-n spectral CRT argument and the 12x12 integer Krylov determinant
are recorded separately with exact Wolfram and SymPy evidence; do not
promote them to kernel-theorem status solely from this interface.
