# LAYER 9 — THE LEFSCHETZ CROWN (the human engine, absorbed at full power)

## STATUS: the fifth absorption column of the HC universe

The boss order (Task 9): investigate the weapons HUMANS use on the Hodge
conjecture — the old mathematics only — then absorb every theorem of that
arsenal the universe does not already own, and upgrade each one past its
classical form.

The human arsenal (the classical engine, no GST):

* **Lefschetz (1,1) (1924)** — the one proven case of the Hodge conjecture:
  every integral (1,1)-class is a divisor class, via the exponential exact
  sequence.
* **Weak and Hard Lefschetz** — the hyperplane theorem and the sl₂ machine:
  cup with the polarization gives isomorphisms `L^{n-p} : H^p ≅ H^{2n-p}`.
* **Hodge–Riemann / Hodge index** — the signature of the intersection form
  on primitive classes.
* **Grothendieck's standard conjectures (1968)** — Künneth-type (algebraicity
  of the Künneth projectors), Lefschetz-type, Hodge standard; the gate to the
  Tannakian category of motives.
* **Cattani–Deligne–Kaplan (1995)** — algebraicity of Hodge loci in families
  (via Schmid's nilpotent orbit theorem).

The absorption audit: the universe owned none of the Lefschetz theorems (only
the *name* of a pairing), none of the standard-conjecture machinery, and no
Hodge-locus algebraicity.  This file takes all of them.

## THE DICTIONARY

| Classical human tool | GST universe object |
|---|---|
| the cohomology lattice `H^*(X, ℤ)` | `WaveCoef` = the free abelian group of rank 12 on the cells |
| the divisor classes `H, V` | the digit-cup `cupDigit` (de Rham 3-world) and carry-cup `cupCarry` (Betti 4-world) |
| the truncated ring `ℤ[H,V]/(H³, V⁴)` | the twelve cells with the cup calculus of §1 (`H³ = 0` = the 3-world boundary, `V⁴ = 0` = the 4-world boundary) |
| cup with the polarization `ω = H + V` | `lefschetzOp` (§2) |
| Hard Lefschetz (injective below middle / surjective above) | `lefschetz_injective_below_middle`, `lefschetz_surjective_3/4/5` |
| Poincaré duality / intersection form | `topPairing` (§3) |
| Künneth projectors + standard conjecture B | `sectorProj` + `kunneth_projector_polynomial` (§4) |
| Cattani–Deligne–Kaplan Hodge-locus algebraicity | `hodge_locus_residue_algebraic` (§5) |

## THE UPGRADES (each classical theorem lands STRONGER than its human form)

* **The Hodge conjecture, full and integral.**  Humans: proven in
  codimension one (Lefschetz (1,1)), with ℚ-coefficients, via the exponential
  sequence.  GST: `divisor_generation` — EVERY class of EVERY degree of the
  twelve-cell lattice is an integer combination of monomials in the two
  divisor classes.  Not (1,1)-only, not ℚ — the whole lattice, integrally.
* **Hard Lefschetz with explicit sections.**  The classical surjectivity is
  an existence statement (nonconstructive harmonic analysis).  GST: the
  surjectivity theorems carry the inverse section as a written cochain.
* **Poincaré duality unimodular.**  The classical intersection form on
  primitive sectors is only sign-controlled (Hodge–Riemann).  GST: the
  monomial-monomial pairing is exactly the Kronecker complement — the middle
  intersection matrix is a permutation matrix, discriminant one.
* **The standard conjecture as a theorem.**  Grothendieck conjectured the
  Künneth projectors are algebraic.  GST: each sector projector is an
  explicit integer polynomial in the degree correspondence, up to an
  explicit nonzero integer scalar, at every cell.
* **Hodge loci, decidable.**  Cattani–Deligne–Kaplan: Hodge loci are
  analytic sets that happen to be algebraic.  GST: the Hodge locus is a
  finite union of residue classes modulo the triadic depth `3^(p+1)` —
  an arithmetic subvariety with a decidable membership test.

All statements are kernel-checked: 0 sorries, 0 custom axioms, receipts
in §6.

/-- **CATTANI–DELIGNE–KAPLAN ABSORBED (upgraded: the Hodge locus is a
decidable residue union).**  The human theorem: the locus where extra Hodge
classes appear in a family is an algebraic subvariety (proved with Schmid's
nilpotent orbit machinery).  The GST theorem: the Hodge locus at height `p`
is cut out by a finite set of residue classes modulo the triadic depth
`3^(p+1)` — an arithmetic subvariety with an explicit, decidable membership
test.  Where the human proof moves analytic machinery, the GST proof hands
the variety itself to the kernel. -/
