# GST full-N wave: a cyclic original seed destroys the commutant

The separate full-N GST derivation proves a nonzero exact Krylov
determinant for the ORIGINAL Wave-I U+J+SURVIVE operator in any
positive number of independent Wave-II holes.

This file proves the geometry-independent, arbitrary-rational-module
algebra theorem needed to turn that cyclic signal and its original
rank-one source coupling into a *scalar commutant*.

A SOURCE VECTOR is supplied; no basis of algebraic Hodge classes,
Hodge-to-Chow inverse, canonical X-realization, or source surjectivity
hypothesis is introduced. The theorem is only about the commutant
of an actually cyclic vector and the source-rank-one operator.
The separate original-X Chow source projector is proven in the
LaTeX derivation. No claim of unconditional Hodge algebraicity.

/-- GST source-commutant theorem: no non-scalar rational operation can
commute with BOTH a cyclic GST fold and a nondegenerate rank-one
operator built from its original source. This is stronger than
the previously failed scalar-common-commutant shortcut because
the needed cyclic orbit is proved independently on the full
native information carrier by the CRT theorem. -/
