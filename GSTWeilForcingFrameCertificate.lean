## What is certified here (all statements are exact finite algebra)

Part A — THE WEIL PROJECTOR CORRESPONDENCE ALGEBRA.
For the discriminating Weil fourfold A with the isogeny f = [2+i], the spectral projector onto the
rational Weil plane is P_W(t) = -((t-25)(39t-79)(t^2-30t+625))/44000000. We certify:

1. The expanded numerator pwN t = -39 t^4 + 2224 t^3 - 57970 t^2 + 718000 t - 1234375,
   hence the CORRESPONDENCE COEFFICIENTS a_j (the rational coefficients of the transpose-graph
   algebraic correspondence Pi_W^CH = sum_j a_j * Γ_{f^j}):
   a_0 = -79/2816, a_1 = 359/22000, a_2 = -527/400000, a_3 = 139/2750000, a_4 = -39/44000000.
2. The key identity  pwN t + (t^2+14t+625)(39t^2-2770t+72375) = 44000000.
3. The spectral evaluations: P_W = 1 on the Weil factor (t^2+14t+625 = 0),
   P_W = 0 on the mixed factor (t^2-30t+625 = 0), P_W(25) = 0 on the ambient factor.

Part B — THE EXTERIOR SIGN-COUNT CERTIFICATE FOR INT W_R^2 = 8.
W_R = Re(Omega), Omega = wedge_{j=1..4}(e_j + i f_j), has eight ±1 monomial components
(DATA from the exterior algebra; the expansion and the vanishing of the 56 non-complementary
ordered products are elementary and proved in the derivation .tex). Each surviving ordered
complementary pair contributes s_i * s_j * invsign(l_i ++ l_j), where invsign is the parity sign
of the concatenated index list. We certify, by full evaluation (`decide`), that the eight
contributions sum to exactly 8:  INT W_R^2 = 8  (equivalently W_R^2 = 8 vol as a class).

Part C — THE END-SIGNATURE ARITHMETIC.
Given the declared geometric inputs as HYPOTHESES (Riemann--Roch on the abelian fourfold with
td = 1 and the certified pairing; Serre duality h3 = h1, h4 = h0), the Euler signature
chi(End F) = -(m^2) * 8 is strictly negative for every nonzero scale m, and the deformation
signature h^1 = h^0 + h^2/2 + 4 m^2 holds. The rigidity arithmetic: h^0 >= 1, h^2 >= 0,
m >= 1 force h^1 >= 5 at the minimal scale m = 1 — no rigid holomorphic realization of the
exact Weil carrier exists at any scale.

## Context (commentary; NOT certified in this file)

Scheme-level statements live OUTSIDE this file's certified scope and are proved in the
derivation .tex with declared external leaves: the geometric identification of the Weil plane
with Q[t]/(t^2+14t+625) and of S with the projected Chow image; the correspondence-action
compatibility (external leaf E1); the reduction of the dichotomy S = 0 or S = W_Q to the
kernel-verified theorem cmWeilStableSourceDichotomy in GSTUniversalCMArithmeticObstruction.lean
(already kernel-verified green; not duplicated here); the one-source reconstruction of explicit
cycles; GAGA; the two-center descent law application; Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch; Serre
duality; the Kunneth unimodularity of the torus K-lattice and the derived minimal scale m0 = 1.
The monomial sign table in Part B is DATA supplied by the exterior algebra (each entry is
independently checkable by hand; the file verifies the complete numerical content of the
period identity). No sorry, no custom axioms, no native_decide.
