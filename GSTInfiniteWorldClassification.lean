# GST INFINITE WORLD CLASSIFICATION

The coherent cosmology already proves:
* every ternary innovation stream builds a coherent WindowTower;
* every WindowTower reconstructs a unique innovation stream.

This file upgrades those inverse statements to an actual equivalence

    WindowTower ≃ (Nat → Fin 3),

and derives complete-observation theorems from it.

Thus controlled GST infinity is not merely inhabited by stream-built examples:
it is exactly the full ternary stream space.  The finite level K is the first
K trits, and the complete two-current trace is a faithful coordinate system
for the entire infinite world.
