# N-cohomology V3 combined with actual GST Hodge native mass

This is the first honest interface between the strengthened N-hole coordinate
module and the existing GST native cycle / Hodge mass framework. The original
research goal remains the all-variety fixed-homology integral current sequence.

An actual rectifiable-current mass is nonnegative on every orientation of an
integral current and is not rational-linear on signed cycles. The Hodge code's
nativeCycleMass is a rational-linear functional on native algebraic cycles.

We PROVE the mismatch on the ACTUAL native algebraic cycle type:
1. If nativeCycleMass were nonnegative on every signed cycle, it would vanish.
2. Any nonzero nativeCycleMass necessarily takes a negative value on some
   signed algebraic cycle.

Therefore N-cohomology cannot use this linear mass to establish a geometric
integral-current calibration bound. The separate geometric mass functional,
integer rectifiability and a class-preserving cycle realization are needed.

This is a correctness-preserving upgrade/combination, not a new Hodge axiom
or a proof of unconditionally existing almost-calibrated currents.
