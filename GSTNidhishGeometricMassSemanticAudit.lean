# GST native-mass geometric-law adversarial audit

An unrestricted UNIVERSAL NativeMassCycleClassBridge is not a theorem of
the existing Hodge-data interface. Its kernel_mass_zero field says
unweighted coefficient mass factors through the cycle-class map:
    cl(Z)=cl(W) -> mass(Z)=mass(W).
But true projective geometry does not generally make coefficient-count
mass invariant under cohomological equivalence. For example,
in projective plane codimension-one Chow/cohomology,
a smooth conic has hyperplane class twice a line while its
single irreducible-component coefficient mass is one;
the cycle conic-2*line has class zero but raw coefficient mass -1.
A formal P² cycle-class model is needed to certify this particular
geometric example in Lean. We do NOT claim that instance is formalized.

The theorems below are unconditional statements about the project's
current definitions. They prove:
1. A collision cl(Z)=cl(W) with different raw masses REFUTES the
   native-mass bridge on that geometric carrier.
2. The zero-class Stage2G semantic countermodel cannot possibly admit
   the native-mass bridge when any native codimension-p point exists.
3. A cohomology-defined intersection/degree readout is ALWAYS invariant
   under equality of true cycle classes (the valid replacement law).

The actual geometric work remaining is to construct the genuine
cohomological pairing from projective intersection/cup/Gysin
geometry and prove its positivity on a canonical native cycle.
Do not impose the false raw-mass kernel law as a new GST axiom.
