# Exact even-Clifford Kuga--Satake tensor: the linear algebra core

Mathematical source:
OpenAI/math, "Algebraic Kuga--Satake correspondences and Hodge conjectures
on a K3 quadratic locus", 30 September 2026, formula
    j_w(v)(a) = v a w.

In the paper, v and w belong to a Clifford algebra and w is nonisotropic,
so w has an inverse after normalizing by its nonzero quadratic value.
The map j_w embeds the quadratic space into rational endomorphisms of the
even-Clifford carrier.  Its exact right multiplier MATTERS: replacing j_w
by an unspecified Hodge embedding loses the prescribed correspondence
tensor and can conceal the hard geometry.

Here we prove the universal noncommutative algebra identity underlying that
construction, with arbitrary rational algebra A (eventually specialized to
the appropriate Clifford algebra).  We show:
* both argument directions are Q-linear;
* j_w is injective whenever w has a right inverse;
* evaluation at the identity recovers v*w;
* composition agrees exactly with ordered noncommutative multiplication.

We do not assert that the corresponding Hodge tensor is ALGEBRAIC on a K3
surface or any abelian variety; that would require a true algebraic cycle.

NEEDS CI RUN LATER.
