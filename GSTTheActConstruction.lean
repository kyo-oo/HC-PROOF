# THE FEEDBACK READ — the construction of the act, begun

One separate file, zero monolith bytes.  The exponent's own digit stream,
fed through the prefix-power's digit stream, IS the power's digit stream:

* **§1 THE SELF-READ LAW.**  `self_read`: for EVERY exponent `K` and EVERY
  row `j+1`, the row-`j+1` trit of `4^K` is the row-`j+1` trit of
  `4^(K mod 3^j)` PLUS the `j`-th trit of `K` itself, modulo three —
  `digit3 (4^K) (j+1) = (digit3 (4^(K % 3^j)) (j+1) + digit3 K j) % 3`.
  The power reads the exponent through the prefix-power: the whole
  ternary stream of every power of four is one feedback system.  At
  `j = 0` it is the row-one read (`row_one_read`: row one of `4^K` IS
  `K % 3`), and `row_one_kill`: every `K ≡ 2 mod 3` fires at row one.

* **§2 THE COLLAPSE INTO THE FEEDBACK TREE.**  `cantorian_iff_feedback`:
  `CantorianPower K` holds IF AND ONLY IF, at EVERY level `j`, the prefix
  noise plus the exponent trit never lands on two.  `the_act_iff_feedback`:
  the act holds IF AND ONLY IF every `K ≥ 8` fires somewhere in the
  feedback tree.  The act, as one object: NO exponent from eight on
  threads the whole tree.

* **§3 THE UNIFORM KILL ENGINE.**  `feedback_fire_of_class`: ONE law that
  fires the digit two at row `j+1` for ANY level `j`, ANY alive prefix
  `r`, and the one dead child-trit `t` — the noise receipt is a closed
  computation, the class membership is a congruence.  Every cascade level
  that has ever been run, and every level that ever will be run, is an
  instance of this single theorem.

* **§4 CASCADE LEVEL FOUR.**  `dust_fire_row_five`: eight new infinite
  uniform classes — `K ≡ 85, 91, 112, 118, 163, 175, 190, 202 mod 243` —
  fire at row five.  The first level whose noise is NONZERO (the
  prefix-powers `4^4, 4^10, 4^31, 4^37` carry trit `1` at row five): the
  feedback warps the survivor set past the Cantor shape.  The survivor
  map: `cantorian_dust_mod_9/27/81/243` — a Cantorian dust exponent's
  residue is pinned, level by level, down to the sixteen surviving nodes
  mod `243` — and `166, 172, 193, 199` among them own a trit TWO at
  position four and still live: the row-five prefix-noise of one absorbed
  the fire.  The tree is richer than the Cantor set from level five on —
  machine-named.

* **§4B CASCADE LEVEL FIVE.**  `dust_fire_row_six`: sixteen more
  infinite uniform classes fire at row six — the first level whose
  noise takes ALL THREE values (`4^31, 4^37, 4^172` carry trit TWO at
  row six).  `noise_window_law`: the noise vanishes beyond the diagonal
  window `4^r ≥ 3^(j+1)`.  `unique_dead_child`: every node owns exactly
  one dead child — the blade's one-of-three named at the feedback level,
  so the survivor map doubles (`2, 4, 8, 16, 32`) by structure:
  `cantorian_dust_mod_729` pins the dust to THIRTY-TWO nodes mod 729.

* **§5 THE SOCKET.**  `hTailF_of_feedback`: hand the tree-escape — every
  `K ≥ 8` fires at some level — and `hTailF` closes through the standing
  green bridges.  `the_construction_receipt`: everything assembled, axiom
  printouts included: the classical three only.

/-! ## §1 THE SELF-READ LAW — the power stream reads the exponent stream -/

/-- **THE SELF-READ LAW.**  For every exponent `K` and every level `j`, the
row-`j+1` trit of `4^K` is the row-`j+1` trit of the prefix-power
`4^(K mod 3^j)` plus the `j`-th trit of `K`, modulo three.  The power's
digit stream is the exponent's digit stream fed through the
prefix-power's digit stream — one feedback system, every row, every
exponent, no hypothesis. -/

lands on two: the entire Cantorian core is the set of exponents that
thread the feedback tree at every level.  Every row of every power is a
level of the tree — nothing outside the tree exists. -/

the Cantorian core, and the feedback tree are one object. -/

one dead child-trit `t` — certified by the closed noise receipt
`(digit3 (4^r) (j+1) + t) % 3 = 2` — kill the entire congruence class
`K ≡ r + 3^j·t mod 3^(j+1)` at row `j+1`: every member fires its digit
