# GST Gate 3 — algebraic cycles from resolved supports on arbitrary X

A geometrically supported Hodge class has extra information beyond its
formal (p,p) type. Let i:Y -> X be a proper morphism from a smooth
resolution of a codimension-c algebraic support on X, and let
p=c+1. The authentic rational Betti Gysin map sends

  H²(Y,Q) -> H^(2(c+1))(X,Q),

raising both Hodge indices by c. Every rational (p,p) class in
its image has a rational (1,1) preimage, by strictness/splitting
of morphisms of polarizable pure rational Hodge structures.

The established Lefschetz (1,1) theorem produces a genuine divisor
D on Y. Its native proper pushforward i_*D is then an algebraic
codimension-p cycle on the ORIGINAL X and its canonical Betti
cycleClass is the prescribed target alpha.

This is a uniform actual-X source-producing theorem for every
codimension p>=1, not a hypothesis of Hodge-surjectivity on X.
The two geometric source obligations are explicitly recorded:
proper push-Gysin/cycleClass naturality and rational Hodge
strictness for an actual resolved algebraic support.

This identifies exactly the resolved-support part of the universal
construction. The support condition is substantive geometric input:
any already algebraic cycle also admits resolved codimension-(p-1)
support by taking suitable algebraic containing cuts and resolutions.
Thus imposing this support condition on ALL Hodge classes would
restate the missing universal source-production task. The present
native formula constructs cycles only after an actual support has
been geometrically exhibited, and its Lean theorem audits that fact.

/-! ## Gate 3: ORIGINAL-X reconstruction from affine algebraic data

Let i:Y -> X be a genuine smooth projective divisor, U=X\Y
its affine complement, and j:U -> X the open immersion.

For p=2, any rational (2,2) Hodge alpha on the original X
whose restriction to U has a genuine affine algebraic cycle
representative Z_U admits an explicit NATIVE algebraic cycle on X.

(1) Close Z_U in X to obtain a native codimension-two cycle C.
(2) The difference delta=alpha-cl_X(C) restricts to zero on U.
(3) Localization for the pair (X,U) gives
        delta in im(i_*:H²(Y,Q)->H⁴(X,Q)).
(4) Rational Hodge strictness + Lefschetz (1,1) produce a
    genuine algebraic divisor D_Y on Y with cl_X(i_*D_Y)=delta.
(5) Return C+i_*D_Y on the ORIGINAL X.

This is an exact affine-to-projective algebraization operation,
unlike the earlier supported-source theorem: the new cycle is
supplied only on the open AFFINE U, and the algebraic divisor
correcting the compactification is constructed by the proof.

Producing Z_U for EVERY rational Hodge target remains the new,
independent affine source-construction obligation.

/-! ## Every positive codimension: affine Chow closure + lower Hodge

The codimension-two reconstruction above uses Lefschetz (1,1)
for a divisor on the boundary Y.

In the general successor p=q+1, exactly the SAME localization
mechanism needs a native codimension-q Hodge cycle on Y, i.e. a
strictly lower-codimension representative. This is a genuine
induction step on p for all original smooth projective X.

It is not a hidden full Hodge-surjectivity input: only weight q
on the boundary is supplied, never the target weight q+1 on X.
The new affine source is an algebraic codimension-(q+1) cycle
on U=X\Y with the prescribed RESTRICTED rational Betti class.

/-! ## Source-free affine vanishing on EVERY original smooth projective X

A smooth affine complex n-fold has the homotopy type of a real CW complex
of dimension at most n (the geometric Andreotti-Frankel bound).
Hence H^(2p)(U,Q)=0 whenever 2p>n. The dimension/Stein theorem is
an external geometric input until instantiated in the analytic Betti
bridge: what follows proves its precise Chow-level consequence.

Unlike the general successor construction, NO algebraic cycle on U
has to be supplied, because the zero native cycle has the required
restricted class. Every surviving rational Hodge target on X is
resolved by a strictly lower-codimension Hodge cycle on the boundary
divisor, pushed forward onto the ORIGINAL X.

For a smooth projective 2p-fold X and a smooth ample divisor Y, the
localization kernel of j*:H^(2p)(X)->H^(2p)(X\\Y) is the Gysin image
of H^(2p-2)(Y). Weak Lefschetz identifies this latter source with
H^(2p-2)(X), so the kernel is the ample/Lefschetz image.
The middle primitive space meets that image trivially by the
Lefschetz decomposition. Thus, unlike the upper-half degrees,
a NONZERO middle primitive class survives on the affine open.

The following all-X Lean theorem isolates the precise rational
linear geometry of that argument. Its two inputs are the standard
Betti localization image theorem and the primitive/Lefschetz
direct-sum separation, NEVER an algebraic-cycle preimage.

/-! ## The first EXPLICIT affine algebraic K-theory source

The smooth affine quadric

  Q₂ = Spec R,    xy = z(1-z)

admits the concrete algebraic 2×2 idempotent

       ( z      x   )
   E = ( y     1-z ).

Unlike a holomorphic bundle arising from Oka–Grauert, the image
of E over the algebraic coordinate ring is a finitely generated
PROJECTIVE MODULE BY CONSTRUCTION. No algebraic K₀ representative
has been chosen or assumed in this theorem.

The recursive Clifford matrix factorization documented in the
Mathbox route record generalizes this source to split affine
quadrics of every even dimension 2p. The immediate Lean theorem
below is its nontrivial rank-one algebraic base case, over EVERY
commutative coefficient ring, with no geometry-specific axioms.

/-! ## UNIVERSAL AFFINE REPLACEMENT projector for arbitrary X

For EVERY projective embedding X⊂P^N, the explicit affine
Jouanolou incidence complement J(X) has coordinate functions
e_ij=x_i λ_j/(Σ x_k λ_k). These are regular on the complement
and satisfy the rank-one equations

  e_ik * e_kj = e_ij * e_kk,    Σ_k e_kk = 1.

The following formal theorem proves the resulting square matrix
is an algebraic idempotent in EVERY size and EVERY coefficient
commutative ring. Thus its image is a genuine algebraic
projective module over the affine incidence coordinate ring.

This is an actual all-X source: no K₀ preimage or Hodge class
was supplied to the construction. This first rank-one source
recovers the algebraic tautological bundle; independent
higher-rank projectors are needed for arbitrary primitive α.

/-! ## Higher-rank affine source from the ACTUAL Jacobian

For a smooth affine complete intersection U⊂A^m cut out by
c equations f₁,...,f_c, its actual coordinate Jacobian
J:A^m→A^c is split surjective: the maximal minors generate
the unit ideal by the Jacobian smoothness criterion, and
Bezout combinations of the minors construct an algebraic
right inverse B with J∘B=id.

The explicit map P=id-B∘J is an IDEMPOTENT with image
ker(J), the algebraic tangent module T_U. This is an
independent higher-rank algebraic K₀ source computable
directly from the equations of U. No desired rational Hodge
class is a premise. On general smooth affine U an algebraic
projective cotangent presentation supplies the analogous
idempotent after a projective-module splitting.

The next geometric task is to calculate which primitive Hodge
directions the Chern classes of such genuinely manufactured
higher-rank projectors actually span on J(X).

/-! ## UNIVERSAL ADAMS SPECTRAL WEIGHT FILTER

The true geometric Adams operation ψ² on algebraic K₀ satisfies
  ch_i(ψ² ξ)=2^i ch_i(ξ).

For any *finite* system of pairwise-distinct rational eigenvalues,
the explicit Lagrange product kills every unwanted eigendirection
and preserves the selected one. This algebraic core has no source
existence, spanning assumption, target-preimage selector or axiom.
The geometric λ-ring comparison supplies eigenvalues 2^i for
i=0,...,dim X, and the same scalar construction purifies
ch_p of ANY GENUINE algebraic K₀ class on an arbitrary X.

It DOES NOT assert that the input ξ realizes a prescribed Hodge
class: building a suitable ξ from arbitrary alpha remains Gate 3.

/-! ## GST UNIVERSAL ALGEBRAIC K₀ SOURCE EXTRACTION ON ORIGINAL X

Unlike the earlier source theorem starting with a GIVEN codimension-p
algebraic cycle, this construction starts from an algebraic perfect
complex / virtual vector bundle E on ORIGINAL X. Algebraic K₀(X)_Q
is an independently geometric source space; choosing E never
asserts that its Chern class equals the target rational Hodge alpha.

For a genuine finite flat projective f:X→P^n let
  u = [f_* O_X] ∈ K₀(P^n)_Q
be the vector bundle of rank deg f. This is invertible in rational
K₀(P^n), because the augmentation ideal is nilpotent.
The genuine projection formula gives f_* f^*(a) = u*a.
Define on actual rational algebraic K₀(X):
  PK(E) = E - f^*(u^{-1} f_* E).
Then f_* PK(E)=0, PK²=PK and its image is EXACTLY ker(f_*).

GROTHENDIECK-RIEMANN-ROCH supplies an ORIGINAL-X algebraic
codimension-p rational CHOW class, for every p:
  Z_p(E) = [ch(PK(E)) Td(T_X-f^*T_{P^n})]_p.
The exact GRR formula gives f_* Z_p(E)=0 for every p.
This uses a TRUE vector bundle / coherent K-class as geometric
source, not an arbitrary Hodge-class operator.

The below Lean theorem kernel-verifies the *general algebraic
projection/idempotent/kernel splitting* without postulating
the desired Chow representative. Identifying its abstract
R-linear input with the official algebraic K₀, and applying
Chern character/Todd GRR naturality, remain separate
geometric-realization inputs; no final Hodge surjectivity follows
merely from the existence of PK.

The previous GST projector assumed a supplied inverse uInv to the
actual finite-flat direct-image bundle u=[f_* O_X]. For an actual
projective n-space base, rational K₀ has nilpotent augmentation ideal.
Writing u=d+eta, where d is the nonzero rational degree and
eta^(n+1)=0, a FINITE polynomial inverse exists:

/-! ## GST NATIVE K₀: DIMENSION-UNIFORM INTEGRAL NUMERATOR

An algebraic rational K₀ projector uses the inverse of the finite-flat
degree bundle u=d+eta, with nilpotent augmentation eta^N=0.
The earlier formula constructed u^-1 rationally, but we also need
an EXPLICIT INTEGRAL numerator to obtain one finite perfect complex
from rational target-sensitive sources.

The following recurrence is a finite integral polynomial of d and eta:
  A_0=0,    A_(N+1)=d^N-eta*A_N.
It satisfies (d+eta)*A_N=d^N-(-eta)^N.
When eta^N=0, it yields
  d^N*u^-1=A_N,
where N=n+1 for K₀(P^n). NO infinite expansion or completion.

Thus clearing the rational target pairing coefficients by D and
the intrinsic finite-flat projector coefficients by d^N produces
a genuine integral virtual K₀ class using only finitely many direct
sums, tensor products, and shifts of independently algebraic bundles.
There is no Hodge-to-K₀ preimage in this polynomial construction.

/-! ## GST TARGET-SENSITIVE K₀ GEOMETRIC BIRTH FROM FINITE SOURCES

Use the independently algebraic perfect-complex family E_i on the ORIGINAL
X, the normalized finite-flat K₀ projector P_K, the degree-p relative-Todd
GRR Chern map chi_p and the true rational primitive intersection pairing Q.

The ACTUAL rational virtual-bundle source selected by target alpha is
  E_alpha = ∑_i Q(alpha, chi_p(P_K E_i)) * (P_K E_i).
All its ingredients are rational and algebraic; no Hodge-to-Chow inverse
or target preimage is chosen. The crucial computational certificate is
  Q(alpha, chi_p(E_alpha))
      = ∑_i Q(alpha,chi_p(P_K E_i))².
Therefore the paired Chern output is automatically STRICTLY POSITIVE if
ANY geometrically constructed source detects the prescribed alpha,
even when Q is indefinite. No generic/nonzero determinant assumption.

The abstract rational K₀ / relative Todd Chern carrier used here is the
precise additive interface awaiting official Mathlib K₀ and GRR instances.
The given maps MUST be the genuine normalized algebraic projector and
Todd-corrected Chern map to instantiate on actual original-X geometry.
This construction does not assume all primitive targets are algebraic.

/-! ## ACTUAL PERFECT-COMPLEX DENOMINATOR-CLEARING INTERFACE

Rational algebraic K₀(X)_Q is not itself the set of literal perfect
complexes: a rational virtual class must have its denominators cleared
to a genuine integral K₀ class before it is represented by a finite
direct sum of complexes and parity shifts.

For finitely many geometric sources, the target coupling coefficients
are RATIONAL. Their finitely many denominators admit a common
positive integer D. A simultaneous integral coefficient vector m_i
then represents D times the rational source. The resulting *integral*
virtual class is realized by an ACTUAL perfect complex using finite
direct sums for positive coefficients and odd shifts for negatives.

This Lean identity checks the final algebraic clearing formula for
any explicit certificate (D,m). The common-denominator existence is
the elementary finite rational arithmetic fact and its scheme-level
perfect-complex realization is geometric, not faked as a `Type*` lemma.

/-! ## GST FINITE-SOURCE DETECTION COMPLETENESS AND NULLSPACE

The exact same target-sensitive K₀ source E_alpha has a stronger
interpretation than one positive period: its true algebraic Chern
class vanishes IF AND ONLY IF every independently geometric
source period Q(alpha,z_i) vanishes. This is a *precise theorem about
a fixed genuine source family*, with no assumed ability to
construct sources for every missing Hodge direction.

It gives a falsifiable source-expansion invariant: the only
undetected rational Hodge targets form the common orthogonal
kernel of the current actual perfect-complex source periods.
Even in indefinite rational intersection geometry the identity
holds because the test uses rational squares, not Q(alpha,alpha).

/-! ## GST TARGET-BORN SOURCE EXPANSION — MEASURABLE NEW COMPLEX

A new actual original-X algebraic perfect complex E, built by geometric
Hilbert, CM-NM, incidence, or determinantal methods, must be tested
against a prescribed primitive alpha by its actual Chern period q.
The GST target-sensitive finite source frame has an EXACT growth law:
when E is added to a catalog, its measured total alpha pairing grows
by q², independently of any self-intersection Gram normalization.

Thus one native complex with q≠0 immediately revives a target
undetected by every previously constructed complex; q² is an
objective, computable growth certificate. No hRank, external
source-basis period determinant, or target Hodge preimage is assumed.
The geometric task is to CONSTRUCT that fresh complex E.

/-! ## GST TODD-DEFECT COUPLING OF TWO ACTUAL ORIGINAL-X SOURCE ENGINES

The universal Chow trace projector Pi_CH and the finite-flat
normalized K₀ projector Pi_K have the SAME pushforward kernel, but
their two algebraic source output formulae are NOT termwise equal.

Let f:X→P^n be finite flat degree d. Work in CH*(X)_Q with
  t = Td(T_X-f* T_P)                (relative Todd)
  u = f* ch([f_* O_X])             (algebraic degree bundle)
  s = f* ch(f_* E)                 (pushforward source)
  q = ch(E)*t                     (actual GRR-normalized E-source).
Write uInv=f* ch([f_*O_X]^{-1}). Then u*uInv=1 and
  Pi_CH(q) = q-d^{-1}s,
  Theta_X(Pi_K E) = q-(uInv*s)*t.

Their difference is the NEW intrinsic source
  Delta_Todd = t-d^{-1}u
  Pi_CH(q)-Theta_X(Pi_K E)=(uInv*s)*Delta_Todd.

Thus every Chow trace-zero source coming from coherent E decomposes
into an explicit normalized K₀ primitive source plus a multiple of
ONE INTRINSIC ALGEBRAIC relative-Todd defect on the same X.
This exact identity is valid for EVERY X, degree and codimension,
without target Hodge data or Chern-preimage selectors. On a

separate geometric inputs and are not manufactured by it.

/-! ## GST FIRST-CHERN TODD CANCELLATION FOR TRANSVERSE POLARIZATIONS

In the codimension-at-most-one truncation of rational Chow/K₀ on the
projective base, write u=d+t for the Chern character of f_* O_X
and f_*L=d+t+q for a line bundle L on original X.
The nilpotent positive-degree classes satisfy t²=tq=0.
The finite inverse is dInv-dInv²*t, and its normalized product with
f_*L is exactly 1+dInv*q. Thus relative Todd terms cancel in
the first-Chern source: ch₁(P_f^K L)=c₁(L)-d⁻¹f* f_* c₁(L).
The mathematical identity below is exact in ANY commutative ring
with the stated positive-degree truncation, not merely numerically
tested on special varieties. Actual Chow/GRR realization is separate.

/-! ## GST LEADING-CHERN LAW FOR ACTUAL GEOMETRIC SHEAF SOURCES

The CM/Weil native source is typically supplied by the STRUCTURE
SHEAF O_Z of a genuine algebraic codimension-p incidence or isogeny
graph Z on the ORIGINAL X. Its rational algebraic Chern character
is zero in degrees <p, with degree-p part [Z].

The normalized finite-flat K₀ primitive and its GRR Todd correction
could appear to mix all cohomological degrees. Their exact leading
codimension-p source does NOT: if ch_i(E)=0 and
ch_i(f_*E)=0 for all i<p, then independently of ALL higher Todd and
finite inverse coefficients,
 [ch(P_K E) Td(T_f)]_p =
   ch_p(E) - (1/d)f^*ch_p(f_*E).

Thus the finite-flat normalized K₀ constructor recovers EXACTLY
the genuine native Chow primitive graph-cycle source in the first
nonzero Chern degree. This allows the existing GST CM-isogeny
graph geometry to feed the new algebraic K₀/Chow source engine
without a mysterious Todd mixing assumption or an alpha input.

The theorem below kernel-checks the required arbitrary-p rational
graded convolution, with no finite rank or low-degree cutoff.
The scheme-level support→Chern-leading and true GRR/cycleClass
naturality are geometric inputs, NOT defined as Hodge preimages.

/-! ## GST MIXED INCIDENCE / KOSZUL PERFECT-COMPLEX BIRTH

Let Y be an independently constructed, genuine algebraic codimension-r
subscheme on the ORIGINAL smooth projective X. Let L_1,...,L_s be
independently constructed algebraic line bundles on X and put
  E(Y;L_1,...,L_s) =
    [O_Y] tensor ([L_1]-[O_X]) tensor ... tensor ([L_s]-[O_X]).
As a rational algebraic K₀ perfect-complex class this is constructed
without selecting a Chow representative for any prescribed Hodge alpha.

The exact character starts in codimension p=r+s, with
  ch_p(E) = [Y] * c₁(L_1) * ... * c₁(L_s).
The following graded proofs compute this without assuming away
lower-degree terms or silently setting the relative Todd class to 1.
For finite flat f:X→P^n, GRR and filtration-preserving finite
pushforward show that the leading normalized projector class is
  [Y] * (∏c₁(L_i)) - d⁻¹ f* f_*([Y] * ∏c₁(L_i)).
The Lean layer proves the exact convolution and leading extraction;
a scheme-level native K₀ / cycle-class implementation of its inputs
is NOT manufactured by a rational coefficient sequence.

This provides a genuine codimension-p *source recipe* once the actual
Y and L_i are built, not universal Hodge residual detection.

/-! ## GST ARBITRARY-ARITY NONSPLIT GEOMETRIC SHEAF BIRTH

The prior mixed-incidence law treats one independently existing
scheme-theoretic subscheme Y and one Koszul augmentation packet.
The arbitrary-arity version below accepts ANY finite nonempty
collection of geometrically constructed coherent/perfect sheaf
factors on the SAME original X, including genuine non-split
incidence/graph kernels. The first nonzero Chern degree is the
SUM of the input support/Chern degrees, with NO lower-grade
leakage.

For actual derived tensor products on smooth X, GRR identifies
the leading Chow class with the intersection product of
the factors' independently constructed leading classes.
The exact normalized finite-flat GST K0 / relative-Todd projector
then subtracts the rational projected push/pull leading term;
it never inserts an Hodge-class preimage into the construction.

The Lean theorem proves the rational graded convolution. Instantiating
actual coherent/perfect K0, scheme Hilbert incidence and canonical
cycle-class semantics is separate required geometry. A new target
residual requires a nonzero measured period of the newly born class.

/-! ## GST TANGENT-INDEPENDENT ALGEBRAIC PERFECT-COMPLEX BIRTH

Tangent Chern classes vanish on abelian varieties. The universal GST
original-X K₀ source engine therefore needs a genuinely different
family of constructed algebraic perfect complexes.

For four actual line bundles L1,L2,L3,L4 on ANY smooth projective X,
form the true integral virtual bundle
  (L1-L2) tensor (L3-L4) in K₀(X).
Its ch_0 and ch_1 vanish; its leading ch_2 is
  (c₁ L1-c₁ L2)*(c₁ L3-c₁ L4),
a genuine original-X algebraic codimension-two Chow source.
The first theorem verifies this degree-two Chern convolution.

Independent sharp test: on ANY product X=E1×E2×E3×E4 of
elliptic curves, take actual degree-one factor line bundles.
Let x_i denote the four pullback divisor classes, x_i²=0 and
∫x1*x2*x3*x4=1. The algebraic perfect-complex class has
primitive ch₂ Z=(x1-x2)*(x3-x4), for H=x1+x2+x3+x4:
  H Z=0,  ∫Z²=4.
Thus this source detects a genuine nonzero primitive direction
EVEN THOUGH the abelian tangent bundle is trivial. This extends
the actual GST geometric source catalogue beyond characteristic
classes and projective ambient words, for arbitrary original X
whenever such nonambient line-bundle geometry is available.

Lean checks the exact graded Chow and fourfold exterior-ring
intersection identities. Genuine K₀/chow/Betti realization maps
retain their separately tracked canonical geometry obligations.

/-! ## GST REAL ABELIAN FOURFOLD TWO-SOURCE PERFECT-COMPLEX FRAME

The prior GST Koszul source on E1×E2×E3×E4 gave one algebraic
Lefschetz-primitive (2,2) cycle from differences of true factor
line bundles. A SECOND, differently paired tensor of line-bundle
differences provides an independent source on the SAME original X:

  P=(x1-x2)(x3-x4) from (L1-L2)⊗(L3-L4),
  Q=(x1-x3)(x2-x4) from (L1-L3)⊗(L2-L4).

Both are honest algebraic K₀/perfect-complex sources. With
x_i²=0, ∫x1x2x3x4=1, H=sum_i x_i:
  H·P=H·Q=0, P²=4, Q²=4, P·Q=2.
Thus their TRUE geometric Gram determinant is TWELVE, and the
rational inverse Gram yields an explicit alpha-selected Chow class:
  a=<alpha,P>, b=<alpha,Q>,
  Z_alpha=((2a-b)/6)P + ((2b-a)/6)Q.
Its periods are EXACTLY a,b and its target pairing is

This is a rank-two native source construction on a tangent-trivial
abelian FOURFOLD, not a selection of alpha's algebraic preimage.
It applies to products of four projective elliptic curves with true
factor degree-one algebraic line bundles. The current Lean layer
verifies the *exact canonical-compatible cup/intersection table*;
the independent scheme-to-Betti functor is not replaced by it.

/-! ## GST ALL EVEN DIMENSIONS: EXPLICIT PRIMITIVE KOSZUL K₀ BIRTH

For the ORIGINAL projective abelian 2m-fold
X=E₁×⋯×E₂m, let x_j denote the pullback of a
degree-one line-bundle Chern class from E_j.
Then x_j²=0 in the algebraic Chow ring, and
H=∑_{j=1}^{2m} x_j is an actual ample class.

Pair the factors and form the GENUINE algebraic K₀ perfect-complex
  E=⊗_{i=1}^m ([L_{2i-1}]-[L_{2i}]).
Its leading genuine Todd/Chern codimension-m cycle is
  Z=∏_{i=1}^m (x_{2i-1}-x_{2i}).
Because (x+y)(x-y)=x²-y²=0 for EACH pair, H·Z=0.
Also Z²=(-2)^m∏ x_j; hence (-1)^m∫_X Z²=2^m>0.

This is one INDEPENDENT primitive algebraic native source for
EVERY m>=1 on ACTUAL original even-dimensional abelian products,
with no tangent Chern contribution, selected Hodge preimage, or
unspecified Gram witness. The Lean theorem formalizes these exact
Chow-ring identities in arbitrary characteristic-zero rational
graded commutative intersection algebra; the geometric specialization
requires x_j²=0, ∫∏ x_j=1 and actual line bundle ch/GRR.

/-! ## GST UNIVERSAL DIAGONAL SHEAF -> TRUE ORIGINAL-X CORRESPONDENCE

Use the *actual* coherent structure sheaf O_Delta of the diagonal
Delta_X⊂X×X; this exists algebraically for EVERY smooth projective
original X of dimension n. For a finite flat projection f:X→P^n
of degree d, its square g=f×f is finite flat of degree d².
In true Chow codimension n,
  g_*[Delta_X] = d[Delta_P],
  g^*[Delta_P] = [X×_(P^n)X].
So applying the universal ORIGINAL-X native finite projection to
the geometrically constructed diagonal gives
  Delta_X - (1/d²)g^*g_*Delta_X
    = Delta_X - (1/d)[X×_(P^n)X] = Pi_f.

The coherent sheaf O_Delta is supported in codimension n; its
Chern character first appears in degree n and equals [Delta_X].
The arbitrary-rank supported-sheaf GRR leading-degree theorem above
therefore shows this SAME primitive correspondence is obtained by
applying the NEW finite-polynomial K₀ projector to O_Delta on
X×X, then taking its true Todd-normalized leading ch_n.

Thus the universal Chow diagonal primitive is not an abstract
world-endomorphism: it is an explicit algebraic PERFECT-COMPLEX
BIRTH through the actual original-X diagonal sheaf, coherent
push-pull, and finite algebraic K₀ inverse. The output is a
codimension-n correspondence on X×X, not a codimension-p class
representing a prescribed alpha. Additional target-sensitive
algebraic slicing remains the central source-construction task.

Lean checks the every-degree scalar and native linear-map transfer
once the genuine geometric Chow push/pull identities are supplied.

/-! ## GST MIXED EXCEPTIONAL BIRTH FEEDBACK

A proper blowup pushforward is ADDITIVE, not a ring map. Thus
an old pushforward kernel need not survive multiplication by
cycles created by a second, interacting geometric birth.

For rho: Xhat=Bl_S(X)->X, codim(S)=c, exceptional F, the genuine
Chow identities are projection formula and
rho_*(F^c)=(-1)^(c-1)[S]. They give
rho_*(rho*(Z) . F^c)=(-1)^(c-1) Z.[S].
The new quadric two-birth construction evaluates its further
pushdown as -[point] although the FIRST pushdown of Z is zero.

This law works for arbitrary source rings and codimensions.
It uses the proper birational projection formula, not the
finite-flat inverse-degree projector from earlier sections.
The Chow operations of a concrete blowup remain geometric
inputs; no arbitrary target-cycle preimage is introduced.

/-! ## ORIGINAL-X SMOOTH INCIDENCE CENTERS FROM ALGEBRAIC BUNDLES

For ANY smooth projective n-fold X, p>=1 and p<=n, start with
an actual algebraic bundle E. After a sufficiently ample twist
and adjoining trivial summands, general independent sections
give a globally generated rank-n quotient V with the SAME total
Chern class as the twisted bundle. General n-p+1 sections of V
define the genuine incidence center
  S={(x,[lambda]) : sum lambda_i s_i(x)=0}
in X x P^(n-p). It is a smooth zero scheme of the rank-n bundle
pr_X*V tensor O(1), of dimension n-p (or is empty).
The true projective-bundle push gives pr_X*[S]=c_p(V).
Blowing up along S and pushing the n-th exceptional power gives
(-1)^(n-1)c_p(V) on the ORIGINAL X.

If n<=2p+1, the lower-rank stratum has codimension 2p+2>n;
the determinantal center is already smooth INSIDE X and the
incidence resolution is an isomorphism onto it. In particular
this holds for every primitive middle problem n=2p.

The primitive period ell(u)=(-1)^p integral_X r.u.h^(n-2p)
kills EVERY h-multiple. Thus twisting does not change its
c_p period. Below the complete projective coefficient and twist
laws are proved for all n,p, not a fixed degree test.
For p=2, actual centers from E and E+E recover ch_2(E) with
coefficients -2 and 1/2, with the sharp center-energy bound 4/17.

The center construction is geometric; no arbitrary target
preimage is used. It does not assert an algebraic bundle with
nonzero prescribed residual period exists on every X.

Clear its rational denominator M and write M*xi=[E]-[F].  For a twist m
with F(m) globally generated, let K be the kernel of O^N -> F(m).
The ACTUAL bundle B=E(m) direct-sum K satisfies

rank-n quotient gives ONE incidence center with native push
  binom(rank B,p)*k^p*h^p + (-1)^(p-1)*(p-1)!*M*ch_p(xi).

The following definitions prove the all-p Newton and twist arithmetic.
`chernFromCharacter` is the standard Newton recursion, not a Hodge-to-Chow
map.  The bundle/kernel/section and canonical comparison geometry described
above is distinct from this formal coefficient theorem.  No arbitrary
residual is asserted to supply the input algebraic K₀ class.
