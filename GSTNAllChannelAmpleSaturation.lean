# GST N-cohomology: constructive integral ample-shift saturation in ALL finite ranks

Original research goal: construct fixed-integral-homology almost-calibrated
currents on EVERY smooth projective complex variety for every rational Hodge
class. This file proves an exact N-channel integer model mechanism relevant to
that goal. It is NOT a theorem constructing geometric currents on arbitrary X.

Unlike the two-channel result, this works for any finite N-shape, any signed
integer coefficient vector, any positive integer ample vector b, and any
nonnegative integer channel masses/periods w.

The explicit budget M=sum_i |a_i| produces nonnegative integer coordinates
c_i=a_i+M*b_i. Its weighted homology period is exactly period(a)+M*period(b)
and nonlinear absolute-multiplicity mass equals its period exactly.
Therefore the constant integer sequence of c has calibration defect zero.

To apply this to a genuine complex projective variety, an independently proved
geometric cycle-class realization must identify EVERY rational Hodge direction
with integer combinations of ACTUAL calibrated holomorphic cycles. That
surjectivity is not assumed or proved here.

/-! ## Exact positivity-cone semantics for ALL N-window channels

The construction above only supplied a sufficient positive ample shift.
These results prove NECESSITY as well: whenever every channel has
strictly positive integer mass weight, abstract zero calibration defect
is equivalent to coordinatewise nonnegativity. This is a complete
integer-effective cone, not a claim that X has a realized algebraic
cycle for every coordinate direction.
