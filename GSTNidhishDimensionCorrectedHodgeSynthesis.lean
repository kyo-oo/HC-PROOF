# Nidhish GST dimension-corrected geometric Hodge synthesis

Final combination of two genuinely geometric laws in the right domain:

1. A dimension-bounded BETTI-DEGREE charge on the genuine native
projective successor tower, proving a nonzero algebraic Hodge seed
at each p<=d. Unlike the raw coefficient-mass bridge, this
charge is assumed to factor through actual cycle class.
2. LOCAL actual-geometric cyclicity for each nonzero native cycle
in the same finite weight range, which forces the explicit orbit
of the constructed spine seed to span its entire Hodge fiber.

Weights p>d must have zero rational Hodge fiber (an explicit
geometric vanishing property). No nonzero source is demanded
outside the geometric dimension. This avoids the old unlimited
mass-bridge inconsistency.

Lean proves the exact all-weight rational Hodge target FROM these
three independent geometric premises, constructing an actual native
representative for every requested class.

Crucial distinction: this theorem does NOT prove that all projective
varieties satisfy the bounded degree and cyclicity premises. Their
uniform independent geometric constructions remain the Hodge task.

/-- The actual geometry condition needed for the orbit engine:
every nonzero genuine native algebraic class in the certified
degree range is cyclic under actual Hodge-compatible
finite-closed correspondences. This is local to native classes,
not global irreducibility of the entire rational representation. -/

/-- DIMENSION-CORRECTED HODGE LANDING.
An actual degree-conserving native source and locally cyclic genuine
correspondence actions in every active finite codimension yield
all rational Hodge algebraicity, with no out-of-dimension source
required. The source is built from the projective spine, not
chosen as a preimage of a target class. -/
