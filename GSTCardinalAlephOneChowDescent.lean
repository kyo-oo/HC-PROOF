# Owner's GST aleph-one input / uncountable Chow specialization gate

Companion ACTUAL original-X geometric proof:
research/derivations/GST_owner_aleph1_Chow_specialization_originalX_source_birth_20261111.tex

Main independent set-theoretic leaf:
If an UNCOUNTABLE collection of distinct original GST geometry world
inputs is labelled by only COUNTABLY many profiles, some single
profile occurs UNCOUNTABLY often.

Apply to the profile (positive denominator, positive effective
cycle degree, negative effective cycle degree) in N x N x N.
Relative Chow parameter spaces for a fixed profile are projective
over a smooth projective family base; their finitely many connected
components have locally constant rational Betti cycle class.
On an irreducible algebraic CURVE, a proper closed subset is finite,
so an uncountably populated good component must dominate the curve
and has a true cycle on the prescribed original fiber.

The actual relative Chow properness and specialization are proven
geometrically in the companion source derivation. This file formalizes
the load-bearing cardinal pigeonhole theorem; it is NOT a formal
claim that Mathlib has constructed the relative Chow scheme or that
arbitrary prescribed alpha has nearby algebraic source fibers.
