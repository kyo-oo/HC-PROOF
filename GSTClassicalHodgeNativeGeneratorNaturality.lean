# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — NATIVE GENERATOR NATURALITY

The finite point-transition interface can be weakened further on compact
carriers — in particular on every smooth projective complex scheme.

To prove atomic stability of a rational cohomological observable T, it is
enough to show that for every genuine codimension-p point x, the transformed
class T(cl[x]) is the cycle class of some native codimension-p algebraic cycle.
Compactness then converts that native cycle automatically to a finite rational
point presentation.

Conversely, atomic stability itself supplies such a native witness because the
atomic span is contained in the full cycle-class range.

Hence on smooth projective carriers the following are equivalent:

* global invariance of the atomic cycle-class span;
* generatorwise finite point transitions;
* generatorwise native algebraic-cycle lifts.

This gives the operator attack both a geometric and a combinatorial interface.
