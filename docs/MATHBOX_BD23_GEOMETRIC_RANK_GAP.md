# Mathbox research route — HC-PROOF base bd23bac6

Base commit: `bd23bac6ee8c81c45b71881666a898af093c9046`.
Isolated research branch: `mathbox/bd23-single-operator-charge-wedge`.
Primary Lean file: `GSTClassicalHodgeSingleCorrespondenceRankTwo.lean`.
CI workflow: `.github/workflows/gst-single-correspondence-charge-wedge.yml`.

## Precise original missing implication

The source's genuinely realized finite-closed correspondence expression algebra produces native rational algebraic cycles, but it does **not** prove that the Hodge classes of its outputs span a general rational Hodge fiber. Its finite geometric power-orbit and noncommutative word-frame reconstruction theorems explicitly assume a nonzero determinant / full-rank matrix. No general theorem at the requested base supplies such a matrix on every smooth projective complex variety.

Moreover, `HodgeBigradedBettiData` stores the cycle class as an arbitrary linear map, and `GSTClassicalHodgeStage2GSemanticRigidity.lean` constructs the zero-map countermodel. Thus enlarging the GST abstract matrix-unit algebra, or asserting determinant nonvanishing as a new law, does not itself produce the genuine native geometric cycles demanded by the original Hodge claim.

## Executed route: weight-local charge wedge

At a fixed weight p, choose the native spine cycle `Z = spineNativeTower G p` and its Hodge class `s = spineHodgeSeed G p`. Let `T` be a genuinely realized correspondence expression, and choose one rational **weight-local** functional

```lean
ell : ClassicalHodgeFiber V H p →ₗ[ℚ] ℚ
```

with `ell s != 0`. Define `t = T.cohomologyOperator s`, an algebraic Hodge class because it is the class of `T.cycleOperator Z`.

The following is an actual native algebraic cycle:

```text
DeltaNative(T) = ell(s) • T.native(Z) - ell(t) • Z.
```

By exact native/cohomological naturality, its class is the Hodge-fiber vector

```text
delta(T) = ell(s) • t - ell(t) • s.
```

The charge cancellation is exact:

```text
ell(delta(T)) = ell(s)*ell(t) - ell(t)*ell(s) = 0.
```

If `delta(T) != 0`, it is independent of `s`, since `ell(s) != 0`. When the rational Hodge fiber has dimension exactly 2, the two algebraic classes form a basis. The existing atomic-span/range identity then represents any rational Hodge class with an actual codimension-p rational algebraic cycle.

This route needs **one** genuinely realized correspondence with transverse movement, rather than the earlier two correspondences whose nonzero commutator must also satisfy global charge-eigenfunctional laws.

## Corrected semantic issue in the older route

The older `SpineTowerConservedCharge G` assumes one nonzero base charge transported across **all** natural-number weights. Its theorems imply a nonzero cycle class at **every** such weight. For a genuinely finite-dimensional smooth projective complex variety the rational cohomology eventually vanishes in high degree, so that global premise cannot be offered as a universally inhabited geometric input. The new route uses only a linear readout on the single active Hodge fiber, allowing all other weights to be zero. This correction changes the proof hypotheses rather than declaring incompatible laws universally true.

## Evidence and limitations

- The Lean file contains `movedSpine`, `nativeChargeWedge`, `hodgeChargeWedge`, `nativeChargeWedge_cycleClass`, `hodgeChargeWedge_charge_zero`, `spine_chargeWedge_linearIndependent`, and `every_rank_two_hodge_class_of_one_transverse_correspondence`.
- **Mathematical claim:** an exact rank-two reduction conditional on `ell(s) != 0` and `delta(T) != 0`, not a solution of the unconditional Hodge conjecture.
- **Unproved geometric existence input:** produce such a genuinely realized correspondence with nonzero transverse action on an arbitrary rank-two Hodge fiber, or produce sufficiently many independent genuine algebraic directions in arbitrary rank.
- **Separate semantic input:** identify the cohomology and cycle-class map with the authentic geometric cohomological construction, not an unconstrained record field.
- **Verification:** check the corresponding GitHub Actions kernel compilation and sorry audit. Until a completed green run is observed for the revised commit, label the Lean file *written, verification pending*.

## Smallest decisive mathematical test

For a concrete smooth projective complex variety X with a two-dimensional rational (p,p) Hodge fiber and an independently constructed genuine nonzero algebraic spine Z, exhibit an actual finite closed correspondence T whose action on cl(Z) is not proportional to cl(Z). If none can be produced by the presently supported correspondence algebra, the limitation is geometric (not a missing polynomial-calculus theorem). No unverified universal nonvanishing is promoted to a law.

## Wolfram symbolic checks (14 October 2026)

Wolfram Language evaluated the linear-algebra identities using generic
rational-coordinate symbols. These are exact *symbolic* checks, not a proof
that the relevant geometric correspondences exist.

In rank two let `s=(a,b)`, `ell=(u,v)`, and the image of one
geometrically realized operator `T(s)=(c,d)`. Wolfram returned

```text
w = ell(s)*T(s) - ell(T(s))*s
  = ((b*c - a*d)*v, (a*d-b*c)*u)
ell(w) = 0
det([s,w]) = (a*u+b*v)*(a*d-b*c)
w when T(s)=k*s: (0,0)
sample (s,ell,T(s))=((1,0),(1,0),(0,1)): w=(0,1)
```

Thus the charged wedge creates no independence by algebraic manipulation
alone: it has rank two **exactly when** a genuine realized operator supplies
an image outside the spine line, provided `ell(s)!=0`.

In rank three with two images `t=T(s)` and `q=Q(s)`, Wolfram verified the
polynomial identity

```text
det([s, ell(s)t-ell(t)s, ell(s)q-ell(q)s])
    = ell(s)^2 * det([s,t,q]).
```

This scales to the rank-n structural requirement that n genuine independent
cycle classes exist: charge projection does not manufacture missing
geometric directions. The scalar-correspondence obstruction is a
decisive test for any proposed universal operator argument.

## Public HodgeConjecture integration

The root `HodgeConjecture.lean` is modified on this **same branch**.
It imports the rank-one genuine native spine realization and the verified
rank-two weight-local correspondence implementation, and adds:

- `classicalHodgeTarget_of_weightwise_rank_le_two_actual_geometry`:
  a complete *conditional* public Stage-2G Hodge theorem for weights whose
  fibers vanish, have rank one with an explicit nonzero native spine,
  or have rank two with a verified genuine transverse correspondence.
- `geometric_spine_laws_alone_cannot_establish_classicalHodgeTarget`:
  the precise countermodel showing a spine's current compatibility fields
  do **not** force algebraicity in arbitrary Stage-2G semantic records.

The correspondence module additionally proves
`hodgeChargeWedge_eq_zero_of_scalar_spine_action`,
`hodgeChargeWedge_ne_zero_of_no_scalar_spine_action`, and the corresponding
rank-two Hodge theorem from geometric nonproportionality.

These make the actual missing hypotheses visible in the Lean statements.
They are **not** the unconditional Hodge conjecture. Compiling
`HodgeConjecture.lean` verifies the root declarations *as stated*;
it does not independently construct the missing native geometric inputs.

## Exact unresolved obligations and stop conditions

1. **Genuine cycle-class semantics.** Construct or pin the actual
   rational cohomological cycle-class map and valid geometric
   analytification/bigrading, rather than permitting `zeroCycleClassData`
   to satisfy the purported unconditional framework.
2. **Transverse geometric existence.** For each rank-two live Hodge fiber,
   independently exhibit an actual realized `E` with
   `movedSpine G E` not proportional to `spineHodgeSeed G p`.
   The identity and all scalar actions fail this test.
3. **Higher ranks.** For a dimension n Hodge fiber, produce n independent
   classes of genuine rational codimension-p native algebraic cycles. A
   nonzero n-by-n native Hodge matrix is sufficient, but proving
   nonvanishing generally is the mathematical target itself.
4. **Unconditional classical Hodge.** Universal geometric generation
   without assuming basis-cycle representatives, nonzero determinants,
   or rank-full correspondence packets is not established by any of the
   preceding algebraic reductions.

Lean verification must be read from the new focused GitHub workflow run
for the exact current source commit, not from an older green run.

## Mathbox next proof routes (14 October, 2026 evening)

### Route A — all finite ranks, genuine native charged frames

**New Lean file:** `GSTClassicalHodgeArbitraryRankChargeFrames.lean`

- `nativeChargedFrame` constructs the full n-column native geometric
  cycle frame from the projective spine and at most n-1 nontrivial
  charged images of genuine correspondences.
- `chargedFrameHodgeMatrix` measures those actual cycle classes
  against the complete finite Hodge-fiber basis.
- `chargedFrameInverseCycle` is an explicit inverse-matrix rational
  algebraic cycle for any requested Hodge vector.
- `chargedFrameInverseCycle_spec` proves the exact cycle-class formula
  from nonzero determinant.
- `UniversalGSTChargedGeometricFrameGeneration` names, but does **not**
  prove, the necessary new geometric existence statement.
- `exact_hodge_of_universal_charged_geometric_frames` and
  `HodgeConjecture.classicalHodgeTarget_of_universal_GST_charged_geometric_frames`
  wire this higher-rank criterion to the actual Stage-2G Hodge target.

The target's full rank **has not been derived unconditionally** from the
native correspondence API. A previously compiled version had a specific
Lean elaboration error: the determinant proof argument was omitted when
calling `chargedFrameInverseCycle_spec`. The subsequent commit inserts
that proof argument; verification must use the post-fix CI, not the failed run
`38584682228`.

### Route B — determinant-free actual geometric irreducibility

**New Lean file:** `GSTClassicalHodgeActualGeometricIrreducibility.lean`

- `InvariantUnderActualHodgeCorrespondences` quantifies over
  **genuine realized Hodge-compatible finite closed correspondences**,
  not the abstract GST matrix-unit endomorphism arsenal.
- `algebraicHodgeSubspace_actual_correspondence_invariant` proves
  that the actual algebraic Hodge subspace is stable under these
  genuinely realized geometric actions by cycle-class naturality.
- `ActualHodgeCorrespondenceIrreducible` expresses the independent
  geometric irreducibility property for this action.
- `all_hodge_classes_of_actual_geometric_irreducibility` proves
  that irreducibility plus a nonzero native spine makes every rational
  Hodge class at this weight algebraic.
- `full_hodge_of_actual_geometric_irreducibility` handles all
  weights, treating zero fibers separately, and is integrated into
  `HodgeConjecture.lean`.

This is independent of nonzero determinants, but it still requires
proof that the **actual realized correspondence algebra** acts
irreducibly on a live Hodge fiber. The internal abstract GST arsenal
cannot be substituted for that proof. No field in
`HodgeBigradedBettiData` or `GeometricCycleClassSpine` currently
forces it.

### Research checkpoint

The two active geometric routes are (A) explicit independent charged
cycles, and (B) actual correspondence irreducibility. Both have
fully specified Lean mathematical conclusions and separate falsifiable
hypotheses. Neither bypasses the genuine scheme-correspondence
realization and cycle-class semantic interface.

The all-varieties rational Hodge conjecture remains the unchanged
`HodgeConjecture.ClassicalHodgeTarget`; the two new routes are
**conditional**. This is not an unconditional Hodge solution.

GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/gst-single-correspondence-charge-wedge.yml`
checks both new mathematical files and then the entire public Hodge root.
Always associate conclusions with the exact commit SHA of that run.

### Mathbox adversarial correction: do not confuse sufficient with necessary

The universal nonzero charged-frame determinant and the
actual-correspondence irreducibility hypothesis are **sufficient** for the
public Hodge statement, not proven necessary. The Hodge conjecture might
hold on a carrier even if the particular chosen projective spine is zero
or its orbit under these constrained realized correspondences does not
generate every algebraic class. Thus the failure of either criterion
does not disprove the Hodge conjecture, and universal truth of either
stronger criterion has not been established.

In the Lean source, any wording calling frame-generation
"necessary" refers to the obligation of **that particular proof route**,
not a logically necessary condition for Hodge algebraicity.

## Route C — semantic nonuniqueness of cohomological correspondence action

**Formal target:** `GSTClassicalHodgeCorrespondenceSemanticFirewall.lean`

The current `RealizedFiniteClosedCorrespondence` pairs true finite-closed
scheme geometry `K` with an independently supplied cohomology endomorphism
`T`, and checks naturality on classes of codimension-p algebraic point
cycles. This only constrains `T` on the cycle-class image, not on all Betti
cohomology. Crucially, the ambient Betti group can contain non-Hodge classes,
so even proving every rational Hodge class algebraic would *not* always make
the full ambient point-class image surjective.

The new file formalizes the sharp zero-cycle-class countermodel: for any
given true finite-closed correspondence K and any rational cohomology
endomorphism T, `K.RealizesAmbientOnPoints T` is automatically satisfied
by `zeroCycleClassData H`. When the Betti group is nonzero, the identical
geometry K therefore admits both the zero and identity ambient operators,
different on nonzero Betti vectors. This exposes the independent need to
construct the full cohomological operator canonically from geometric
cup/intersection/Gysin correspondences. A point-class commuting square,
even if true on every native cycle, cannot create or determine the action
outside the native cycle-class image.

**Scope:** This is a counterexample to the strength of the *formal
realization interface*, not to the actual Hodge conjecture on honest
smooth projective complex varieties. Its Lean proof is checked by the
independent GitHub workflow `gst-correspondence-semantic-firewall.yml`;
consult that workflow's completed conclusion before upgrading its evidence
label to kernel-verified.
