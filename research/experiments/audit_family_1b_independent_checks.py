# THE INDEPENDENT AUDIT of the cyclic family transport theorem
# (cyclic_family_checks.py, commit b4b94db).  The auditor's stance: I did
# NOT write that certificate; break it.  Every load-bearing number is
# re-derived by a DIFFERENT route than the certificate used.
#
#   F1  the (1,1) lattice dims (48 at m=3, 64 at m=4) by ORBIT COUNTING on
#       the z x zb pair space -- no characters, no typing machinery, no
#       cyclotomic rings: the plain count of C_m-orbits with the sign
#       structure trivialized by the (even, odd) letter order.
#   F2  the five boss arity numbers (4, 8, 24, 64, 208) by the EXPLICIT
#       polynomial character over the cycle structure (a third route).
#   F3  the return-leg arity law PER BLOCK: each individual lift returns
#       W_R alone (the sum is m W_R because EACH of the m terms returns
#       W_R -- a finer identity than the certificate's summed check).
#   F4  the orbit-basis telescoping law by an independent implementation
#       (matrix-action invariants: solve (sigma - I) v = 0 directly).
#   F5  the parity-wall word structure on m=3/m=4 products by hand
#       expansion of the full word set of the generic grids.
#   F6  the scope lines: the record's NOT-claimed list present verbatim;
#       the script contains no float literals, no complex literals.
#   F7  the primitivity law re-derived: the word-coefficient content of
#       Theta_m (all coefficients 1) makes alphaHat_m/m non-integral for
#       every m >= 2 by inspection -- asserted against the actual dicts.
