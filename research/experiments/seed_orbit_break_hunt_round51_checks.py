"""ROUND 51 CERTIFICATE -- the seed-orbit law, the break-hunt, and the meta-law.

Layers:
  Y0  environment (float scan, stdlib only, vacuity self-scan, no clock)
  Y1  THE SEED-ORBIT LAW (the generator cell; coverage, freeness, the
      boundary cell, path independence, the fence, the birth signatures,
      the generator law, the composition law)
  Y2  THE RIDES / THE ALWAYS-GIVES EQUATION (the seed under the full
      bounded tower family on the split model: range membership, defect
      zero at every prefix; the fold-admission tests; defect deafness; the
      closed defect equation; the defect-pattern persistence; the coupling
      control)
  Y3  THE BREAK-HUNT AT THE CENSUS AVATAR (seventeen committed families;
      per-family verdicts; the aggregate: every rational (p,p) input is
      branch A by exact integer-echelon lattice membership; ZERO natural
      break witnesses; the wave channel-count transcription guard; the
      period and rank receipt anchors)
  Y4  THE SYNTHETIC-BREAK CONTROLS (the planted-witness detection at every
      census world; the persistence of constructed defects under towers;
      the expel-receipt)
  Y5  THE META-LAW CHAIN (branch = defect-sign via membership vs
      coordinate read; the P^2 scale group 2Z with m* = 2 as an exact
      parity computation, the explicit witness receipt; the Gr(2,5)
      receipt anchors; range iff pair-witness; the four-name agreement)
  Y6  hostile battery S1-S6 (orbit corruption, seed tampering, sweep
      masking via a planted break, chain-link flip, seal sensitivity,
      broken-fold rejection -- each detected)
  Y7  the PINNED count seal

BOUNDS (declared BEFORE launch; NO-OOM protocol):
  Y1: orbit p,j <= 40; histories: ALL of length <= 3 over entries <= 4
      (155) plus 20 fixed patterns of length <= 12; the impure zoo: cells
      with coordinates <= 20 (9261) at folds {0,1,3,7,20}; births j <= 20;
      generator powers m <= 20.
  Y2: the split model Z^6; 96 folds (6 unimodular A x 4 coupling D x 4
      unimodular C); 8 representatives; towers: ALL depth <= 3 over the
      representatives (584) plus 24 fixed depth-8 patterns (608 total).
  Y3: the census coherence sweep + the transcendental avatar: 20 committed
      families (the named receipt inputs + the bounded-box sweeps of the
      rational (p,p) lattices, 3,151 inputs total -- the corpus's algebraicity
      receipts VERIFIED, construction-guaranteed, DISCLOSED); PLUS the
      constructed open-world avatar (the rational Hodge lattice uZ against
      the cycle lattice 2uZ: the hunt FINDS the odd-multiple break
      witnesses -- the detection-power receipt).
  Y4: 5 planted witnesses; 12 synthetic defects x 8 towers.
  Y5: the P^2 parity model over (a,b,c,d) in [-6,6]^4 (28561 tuples); the
      Gr(2,5) anchors from a computed ch-table in exact Fraction
      arithmetic at t in {1,2,3}; mixed class+defect inputs in the chain.
  Y6: six sabotages, each on its bounded instance.

Exact arithmetic only: Fraction, integers. ZERO floats. No RNG --
deterministic by pinned enumeration. Double-run byte-identical.

INTEGRITY GUARDS DISCLOSED (AUDIT-51 F1/F3/F7): (1) THE CENSUS
COHERENCE SWEEP IS CONSTRUCTION-GUARANTEED: every committed family's
inputs are integer combinations of that family's own cycle-lattice
generators -- the sweep verifies the corpus's algebraicity receipts
(the worlds' Hodge lattices sit inside their Chow lattices BY RECEIPT),
it does not independently discover algebraicity; the emptiness of the
break-witness set at the committed face is inherited from the receipts.
The hunt's DETECTION POWER is certified independently: the planted-
witness controls (Y4) and the transcendental avatar (Y3b, where the
hunt FINDS natural break witnesses on a constructed open world).
(2) The fold-admission, deafness, chain-link, and closed-equation checks
mirror the block structure of the split model and cannot fail by
construction -- they guard transcription and code integrity of
kernel-real laws. (3) The period/rank/scale receipt anchors (the Weil
periods, the 4462 split, the 360*2/5 arithmetic, the arity totals)
are TRANSCRIPTION guards for committed constants and cannot fail.
Every check that CAN fail carries a real computed predicate; the hostile
battery and the seal verify the file's own teeth.
