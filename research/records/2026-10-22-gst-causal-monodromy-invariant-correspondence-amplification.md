# GST causal monodromy: invariant endomorphism amplification and genuine diagonal Chow source

- **Date:** 2026-10-22 IST
- **Kind:** Mathematical theorem, finite exact verification, in-place Lean upgrade
- **Base checkpoint:** `de5bc31afe217d65392f5e78da33b2ca6e44cdaf` on `research/gpt6-native-point-primitive-span-20261017`.
- **Target:** Pursue the owner's higher-causal-fold intuition **inside the emergent Hodge geometry**: identify genuinely born period sectors, compare monodromy-invariant classes with higher-order invariant operators, and realize at least one such operator as a canonical algebraic Chow correspondence on every smooth projective initial X after an explicitly geometric causal stabilization.
- **Types:** Rational Jordan model V_n=Q^n for the Frobenius Dwork Picard–Fuchs rank-n subsystem; nilpotent J_n e_i=e_(i−1), J_n e_0=0, unipotent rational model T=I+J; original-X cohomological factor U=H^a(X,Q), dimension m, with monodromy I_U⊗T; genuine diagonal Chow correspondence Δ_(X×Y_t) where Y_t is an actual smooth projective Dwork fiber. Analytic monodromy exp(2πiJ) is complex and Jordan-equivalent; a rational Jordan basis is not an automatic canonical period-to-Betti identification.
- **Conventions:** `n≥1`, `m≥1` (m=0 trivial); smooth proper geometry for diagonal; complex dimension `d=n−1`; rational matrix calculations; Hodge structure morphism condition on genuinely algebraic correspondences.
- **Nearest earlier mechanism:** `2026-10-22-gst-all-n-snc-causal-picard-fuchs-hodge-genesis.md` found the rank-one invariant vector channel `ker(T−I)`, but this is **not** a bound on global invariant correspondence tensors or operators. This route changes from vectors to higher-causal endomorphism/cohomological tensor observables.
- **Success criterion:** an explicit all-n nontrivial invariant-operator algebra theorem with proof; an actual algebraic correspondence on a realized smooth projective world acting nontrivially on the born monodromy subsystem; a typed all-original-X product realization; exact finite falsification checks and Lean implementation of the Jordan polynomial independence law.
- **Failure criterion:** if the commuting-operator dimension collapses to fixed-vector dimension or if the purported full-rank algebraic correspondence does not exist on a genuine smooth projective fiber.
- **Attempt outcome:** Complete written algebraic proof for the rational Jordan model and algebraic diagonal; finite Wolfram data checked; formal Lean kernel status recorded separately below.
- **Evidence:** self-reviewed mathematical proof; stateless exact matrix verification n=2..8, and m=1..3 with n=2..4. The Lean theorem is independent of those finite tests; canonical geometric analytic-to-Betti subsystem comparison remains separately typed.
- **Disposition:** Finished all-n invariant correspondence amplification theorem; original-X arbitrary alpha cycle construction remains a separate research goal.
- **Next unresolved mathematical implication:** constructing from these causal correspondences an independent one-legged Chow cycle Z_alpha∈CH^p(X)_Q with canonical Betti image alpha for an arbitrary rational Hodge target on the **untouched** X, without putting such a witness into the input.

## Main theorem

For every n≥1, the Jordan shift J_n on V_n=Q^n has ker J_n=Q e_0, and

```
Cent_EndQ(V_n)(I+J_n) = Q[J_n]
                     = span_Q{I,J_n,...,J_n^(n−1)},
dim_Q ker J_n = 1,  dim_Q Cent(I+J_n) = n.
```

Proof: e_(n−1) is cyclic; a commuting operator is uniquely determined by its image of this generator, which can be reached by a unique polynomial in J_n of degree less than n. Every such polynomial commutes. Evaluation on the cyclic vector proves operator independence.

For each original smooth projective connected complex X and a with m=dim_Q H^a(X,Q), tensor with the rank-n causal period system and monodromy I_m⊗(I+J_n). Blockwise commutation gives

```
dim_Q ker(I_m⊗J_n) = m;
Cent(I_m⊗J_n) = Mat_m(Q[J_n]);
dim_Q Cent(I_m⊗J_n) = m² n.
```

The algebraic diagonal on each actual smooth Y_t and on X×Y_t acts as identity on the entire corresponding rational Betti realization and is invariant under geometric parallel transport. Its rank on H^a(X)⊗V_n is mn. Thus an **actual single globally defined Chow correspondence** may act across all n emergent period directions, although the monodromy-invariant vector subspace has dimension m. This is a genuine derived correspondence action, not a selected Hodge-to-Chow vector.

## The Hodge realization gate is part of the theorem

For fixed smooth projective fibers, every **algebraic** correspondence acts as a rational Hodge morphism. The abstract n-dimensional centralizer is not a family of n independent algebraic correspondences: only those members admitting a canonical Chow realization and respecting the actual pure Hodge structure qualify. For n=2, J=[[0,1],[0,0]] fails to commute with the complex structure matrix [[0,-1],[1,0]] of an elliptic curve, giving an explicit obstruction to equating monodromy commutation with Hodge compatibility.

The same causal degeneration's **limiting mixed Hodge** operator N has type (-1,-1) between weight-graded parts. The existing `GSTGradedWorldAlgebra.lean` is edited with `CausalHodgeCell.monodromyLower`: at indices 0≤r≤min(p,q), (k,p,q)→(k,p−r,q−r), preserving signed charge but decreasing the purity gap by 2r. This is a causal operation **internal to Hodge genesis**, not a separate topological analogy. Genuine limit-MHS existence relies on the actual geometric degeneration, not the abstract typed cell alone.

## Wolfram exact finite computation

Source `research/computations/gst_causal_monodromy_correspondence_centralizer_2026_10_22.wl`. Rerun from committed bytes using WolframLanguageEvaluator, with exact rational coefficient arrays. For n=2..8: nullity(J)=1, commutant dimension=n, polynomial powers independent rank=n, [J^k,J]=0 and J^n=0; all TRUE. For m=1..3 and n=2..4, all 9 block-matrix cases gave fixed-vector dimension m and commutant dimension m²n; all TRUE. Non-Hodge example [J,complex structure]={{1,0},{0,-1}} ≠0. These finite tests corroborate but do not replace the all-n cyclic-vector proof.

## Remaining boundary

No inference from `Cent(J_n)=Q[J_n]` to `CH^d(Y×Y)_Q` surjectivity is claimed. The existing universal original-X Hodge class `alpha` remains an independent target, whereas the genuine diagonal correspondence and the Dwork period local system are explicit successful realized inputs.
