# GST Decision Attempt in the Charge Frame: Obstruction Map, Sector Rigidity (W7), and the Funnel to the Vertex

**Date**: 2026-10-26
**Cycle**: 4, Strike 2 (route (b), ULTRA MODE; boss directive: finish the work in this round)
**Derivation**: `research/derivations/GST_decision_attempt_charge_frame_sector_rigidity_and_funnel_2026_10_26.tex`
**Certificate script**: `research/experiments/task14c_decision_attempt_checks.py` (bounded: exact Fraction arithmetic; 70-word census + sector closures + 96-instance (m,q)-grid + 4 twist checks; < 5 s; no floats; all green)
**Lean layer**: `GSTPairChannelWallsCertificate.lean` (the wall arithmetic; CI arc below)
**Registry movement**: NO route → BLOCKED (characterized); YES route → BLOCKED-funnel (characterized); reopen conditions recorded.

## What the strike delivered

1. **The NO-route obstruction map** (six attack lines, six certified deaths): moduli-connectedness (dies: locally-constant q jumps are permitted; the needed statement IS the unproved rigidity); corridor-invisibility kill chains (dies at W4: the V2 chain needs a bundle; the pair difference is a K^0 class with no band structure); FM-closure via product worlds (dies at W0's own failure locus at NS-rank >= 2: the corridor has no exit); isogeny scaling (dies at T1–T5 + M: consistent at every level); End-mass twisting (dies at W6(v): q is a free integer, every table value realized); lattice/parity (dies at the committed m0 = 1: no divisibility obstruction on the fourfold).

2. **The additive-completeness theorem (the corridor symmetry)**: every additive invariant of a pure pair factors through the (r, k, m, q)-profile of W4–W6; the profile is consistent at every certified grid point (96 instances, zero failures); therefore NO additive wall can separate the charge strata — any future deciding wall must be non-additive AND FM-closed (per W5).

3. **Lemma W7 (sector rigidity of the cohomological FM transform)**: the complement structure preserves the NS/W/T sector decomposition (block-union words complement to block-union words; one-letter-per-block words to same-parity ones — even to even, odd to odd; T-words to T-words; census 6/16/48). Corollary W7.1 (transform-transport kill): the FM orbit of the NS-sector never meets the Weil sector. Corollary W7.2 (projector-birth kill): under the committed spectrum census + leaf E1, ch(P_W(x)) = the Weil component of ch(x) — the algebraic projector cannot BIRTH Weil content from NS/T content (P_W = 1 on Weil, 0 on mixed, P_W(25) = 0 on the ambient/NS factor: all kernel-green).

4. **The Funnel Theorem**: the bit is equivalent to the W-charged-surface existence (equivalently a pure pair at some scale — the committed W2/W1 equivalence, attributed and recorded as normalization per M3); and every mechanism family in the committed arsenal — divisor intersections (W0), tensor/line-bundle transports (W0 + twist check: twisted pairs stay pure at the same scale), FM transforms (W7.1), projector correspondences (W7.2), isogeny transport (T-laws; the split worlds are not isogenous), Segre/pushforward on NS-sector cycles (the q = 0 carrier slice) — generates q = 0 content only. The YES route's remaining content is exactly the vertex.

## The certified terminal state

The campaign's certified reduction stack: HC on the open sector ⟺ FS_∀ (cycle 3, CI green 40125515707 + 40128033668, audit-closed 11-c) ⟺ at the forcing vertex: ONE W-charged surface on the discriminator exists (equivalently: one pure pair at some scale; equivalently: the bit S = W_Q). Both resolution polarities of the campaign contract (PROMPT §2) remain armed; neither fires within the current system; the funnel theorem is the terminal certified statement of this strike. The vertex is the campaign's remaining target; the reopen conditions (non-additive FM-closed rigidity mechanisms for NO; any W-charged surface construction for YES — per-world vertex certificates, deformation transports, non-abelian correspondences) are the next-movement menu.

## Discipline

- Scope box in the dossier: claimed = the obstruction map, W7 + corollaries, the completeness theorem, the funnel; NOT claimed = any decision, any resolution, exhaustiveness beyond the enumerated mechanism families, permanence of the blocks (registry reopen rules govern).
- M3 attribution: the funnel's equivalence content is the committed W2/W1 (recorded as normalization); the new content is the obstruction map, W7, the completeness theorem, the mechanism list.
- Labels: W7/W7.1/W7.2 extend the committed W-frame; no committed label reused; the strike-2 V-labels untouched.
- Verification: the task14c script (all green, bounds stated); the Lean layer's CI arc: round-1 run 40138713492 failed with three verified diagnoses (kernel-stuck decides from bitwise/flatMap primitives — replaced by the committed div/mod + structural idioms; a REAL sign slip in the hypothesis-form t3 line d = t1 − t2 corrected to the telescoped d = t1 + t2, kernel-caught, the direct instance computations correct throughout; a capstone projection off by one conjunction level); round 2 pushed at c97c5c0; round 3 (the all-integer model) pushed at c6a2778 and **GREEN: run 40139821467 @ c6a2778** (capstone_A [propext], capstone_B [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound], capstone_C [propext]; sorryAx-clean).
- English-only (ledger 081); banned-word gate run at commit time (ledger 076).
