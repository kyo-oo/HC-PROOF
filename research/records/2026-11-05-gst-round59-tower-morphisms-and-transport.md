# Round 59 — the tower morphisms and the transport laws

Date: 5 November 2026, Asia/Calcutta. Base revision: `667f602`
(the Round 58 receipt-binding commit; before it the Round 58 round
`3e853ce` at base `b7d6a1c` — the Round 57 receipt-binding). Branch:
`research/gpt6-native-point-primitive-span-20261017`.

Operator order (the standing round order, verbatim essence): "NEW
FIELDS, NEW THEOREMS, GO" — issued with the operator's Q2 verdict
(the campaign's terminal state, Round 55's record) and renewed this
session ("INVOKE THE MATHS SKILL, BERSERKER MODE, GO"). This round is
the standing order's execution on the Round 58 green baseline: two new
faces, both exact algebraic identities over supplied data.

## Face 1 — the tower morphism and the transports

* **THE TOWER MORPHISM** (`TowerMorphism`, new structure): a
  ℚ-linear map `f : V →ₗ W` between the underlying spaces of two
  infinite memory towers, commuting with the base differential
  (`f ∘ d = d' ∘ f`) and every memory jet (`f ∘ φ_k = φ'_k ∘ f`) —
  the map of ε-families. The identity morphism: every tower is a
  morphism of itself.
* **THE CURVATURE TRANSPORT** (`map_curv`): a morphism commutes with
  every curvature carrier — `f ∘ K_k = K'_k ∘ f` — the memory law's
  chase: both memory laws transport term by term through the base
  and jet compatibilities (pointwise `map_base_apply` /
  `map_jet_apply`), so the carriers — their common value — transport
  too.
* **THE NATURALITY OF THE DIFFERENTIAL** (`jetMap_differential`): the
  levelwise extension `F` of a morphism to the infinite jet spaces
  commutes with the infinite differentials at every level —
  `F (D u) = D' (F u)` — the base and jet compatibilities transported
  level by level through the differential's own sum decomposition.

## Face 2 — the functoriality

* **THE NATURALITY OF THE SQUARE** (`jetMap_square`):
  `F (D² u) = D'² (F u)` — both sides the curvature ladder, the terms
  matched by the curvature transport; the jet-space extension
  commutes with the whole curvature cascade's first step.
* **THE FLAT TRANSFER, POINTWISE** (`map_curv_flat`): a morphism
  carries flat towers to flat towers on its image — every curvature
  carrier of the target vanishes at every image point.
* **THE CARRIER TOWER'S FUNCTORIALITY**
  (`carrierTowerMorphism`): the SAME map is a morphism of the
  carrier towers — the map commuting with the family commutes with
  its curvature, hence with the curvature of its curvature, at every
  order of the cascade: the curvature cascade is functorial.

## Scope discipline

All statements are exact algebraic identities over supplied data
(linear-map identities and finite ℚ-linear-map sum identities),
kernel-verified by the module's own CI lane
(`gst-tower-morphism-transport.yml`, runtime lib registration — the
committed lakefile untouched) on the pinned toolchain
`leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0-rc2` with Mathlib. Zero `sorry`, zero axiom
declarations, zero `native_decide`. The kernel-verification receipt
will be bound to this record in the receipt-binding commit once the
module's CI lane lands (the ledger-110 discipline: no receipt is
claimed before the artifact exists; this record references only
artifacts that exist at write time). The geometric identification of
the tower with actual cohomology stays hand-level; no original-X
algebraic-source existence is claimed, assumed, or concluded. The
campaign's terminal state is the operator's Q2 verdict (Round 55's
record); the remaining falsifiable line of the prior sessions'
discipline (the single law FS) is recorded as standing at the
operator's adjudicated basis.
