# GST Pair-Channel Walls: Ring Annihilation, FM Duality of the Dichotomy Bit, and the Weil-Charge Table
**Cycle 4, Strike 1 — the structural strike on FS_∀ at the forcing vertex (boss directive 2026-10-26: route (b), ULTRA MODE). 2026-10-26.**

## What was struck
Cycle 3 left the campaign at one universal law (FS_∀: every Hodge input has m* > 0) with the
truth concentrated at the fixed forcing vertex: on the nonsplit Q(i)-Weil fourfold discriminator
A, the committed W2(iii) makes the pair form equivalent to the dichotomy bit S = W_Q, and
S = 0 is the campaign's negative certificate (PROMPT §2). The cycle-2 walls
(Euler-zero, RR-invisibility, spread no-go, End-mass) bind exact CARRIERS only. The one
channel where the vertex truth can hide is the general holomorphic PAIR (E_+, E_-). This
strike extends the wall system to all holomorphic pure pairs and proves the structure theorems
that make the decision frame arithmetic, duality-invariant, and charge-based.

## New theorems (all proved from committed, kernel-certified constants; no new period input)
- **Lemma W0 (ring annihilation).** theta^j ∧ W = 0 as a CLASS for every j ≥ 1 and every
  W ∈ W_Q: each Weil monomial carries one letter of every symplectic pair; every NS-word fully
  occupies at least one pair. Upgrades the committed 48-pairing INTEGRAL collision to class
  annihilation; explains all walls; fails on split worlds precisely because NS-rank ≥ 2 there
  (consistency probe: no contradiction with Weil's construction, the walls are rank-one-NS
  corridor phenomena).
- **W4 (pair invisibility corridor).** For any holomorphic pure pair at scale m:
  chi(A, E_+⊗L) − chi(A, E_-⊗L) = 0 for EVERY line bundle L (and every Pic^0 twist); more
  generally chi(E_+⊗G) − chi(E_-⊗G) = m⟨W_R, ch_2(G)⟩ for every perfect G. The pair channel
  is MORE invisible than the carrier channel (which retains rk·k^4): the entire additive
  line-bundle family is blind; the only linear detector is the non-additive Weil pairing on
  ch_2(G).
- **W5 (FM duality of the pair channel and the dichotomy bit).** The cohomological FM
  transform is the grade reflection k ↦ 4−k (self-reflective at grade 2 = g/2) with
  **Phi_hat(W_R) = W_R-dual and Phi_hat(W_I) = W_I-dual EXACTLY (coefficient 1, round trip
  the identity)** under the dual-basis Poincaré convention (verified exactly in the
  certificate). Pair-existence transports along the FM equivalence at the SAME scale
  (g = 4 even: the [−8] shift is trivial in K^0), and with the committed W2(iii) on each
  world: **S_A = W_Q(A) ⟺ S_dual = W_Q(dual)** — the dichotomy bit is duality-invariant;
  the discriminator and its dual decide together; every future wall must be FM-closed.
- **W6 (pair Chern table / Weil charge).** A pure pair at scale m has: equal rank; equal
  c_1 ∈ Z·theta; EQUAL c_3 (the shift −m·c_1∧W_R dies by W0); c_2-difference −m·W_R;
  c_4-difference (c_2(E_+)^2 − c_2(E_-)^2)/2 (determined); and Weil charges
  q(G) := ⟨W_R, c_2(G)⟩ ∈ Z differing by EXACTLY −8m. The mixed-End Euler table:
  chi(End E_+) − chi(E_+⊗E_-^v) = 8m^2 − m·q(E_-); chi(E_+⊗E_-^v) − chi(End E_-) = −m·q(E_-);
  chi(End E_+) − chi(End E_-) = 8m^2 − 2m·q(E_-). Carrier consistency: at q = 0 recovers the
  committed End-mass law chi(A, End F) = +8m^2 (W3 instance). The pair channel extends
  through all integer q — the carrier layer is the q = 0 slice.
- **Corollary (the three faces of the bit, M3-normalized).** S = W_Q ⟺ pair at some scale
  (committed W2) ⟺ two bundles with shared (rank, c_1, c_3) and the determined c_4-constraint
  whose Weil charges differ by 8m (W6) ⟺ the same on the dual world (W5). NO route = charge
  rigidity within the fixed-Chern strata (then S = 0: W_R nonalgebraic — the negative
  certificate); YES route = produce the charge split (the detected surface then exists by the
  committed one-source reconstruction).

## Scope discipline (unchanged M-laws)
The walls are necessary conditions + transport structure on the pair channel — the same
epistemic status as the cycle-2 V1/V2/V3 walls. NOT claimed: any decision of the bit; any
monoid-bit claim; exhaustiveness; any resolution of the target. The Corollary is M3-labeled
normalization with both directions attributed.

## Verification
- Bounded exact-arithmetic certificate: hodge-campaign/experiments/task13d_pair_walls_verify.py
  (exterior model; ≤ 2^16 monomial ops; < 1 s; committed with the dossier). Verifies: all
  committed constants re-confirm (∫W_R theta^j = 0 j=1..4, ∫theta^4 = 24, ∫W_R^2 = ∫W_I^2 = 8,
  ∫W_R W_I = 0, Omega·Omegabar = 16 vol); Lemma W0 (zero surviving monomials); the FM
  normalization (coefficients exactly 1, both round trips); W6 synthetically on four instances
  (including c_1 = k·theta ≠ 0 and non-carrier charges q ≠ 0) with grade-by-grade purity
  checks; the carrier instance (q(F) = −8m, chi(End F) = 8m^2); the linear-detector identity.
- Independent extraction + re-verification (Task 13-b, separate agent): re-read all committed
  dossiers/records/certificates; re-derived the collision, the surjection count, W_R^2 = 8,
  the projector polynomial P_W (expansion, key identity, spectral values), the companion
  determinant and one-source reconstruction; cross-checked chi(F⊗L) = rk k^4 (315 cases) and
  chi(End F⊗L) = r^2 k^4 + 8m^2 (180 cases): zero disagreements; produced the ten-pitfall brief
  this strike absorbed (W1(v) pair-leg scope, the V-label map, the spectrum-census leaf
  discipline, WIT-vs-WIT-per-point, the strike-2 D1 attribution over-reach flag).
- Lean certificate: DRAFT PLAN (labeled, not kernel-checked at this commit) — the W0/W4/W6
  arithmetic layers are decide-able in the committed certificate style ("GST Pair Channel
  Walls Certificate"); to land next phase with CI receipts (no local Lean; GitHub Actions only).

## Provenance and receipts
- Builds on: W1/W2/W3 (cycle 2 strike 1: CI 40105212209/40108110670/40109050940; audit-closed
  9-c), V1/V2/V3 + End-twist table (cycle 2 strike 2: CI 40114706009 @ 616d87e; audit-closed
  10-c), the for-all-N reduction (cycle 3: CI 40125515707 first green, 40128033668 audited
  state @ 5d58a9e; audit-closed 11-c; repo HEAD b86d0bc at strike start, verified live).
- This commit: research-only (.tex + record + INDEX + workspace certificate script); no
  .lean, no .yml; no workflow fires.
- Next movement: (1) the Lean certificate for the wall arithmetic → CI green; (2) the
  independent adversarial audit loop (Mode B Phase 4) on this strike; (3) the decision attempt
  within the sharpened frame — charge-rigidity (NO) vs charge-split construction (YES), both
  duality-armed.
