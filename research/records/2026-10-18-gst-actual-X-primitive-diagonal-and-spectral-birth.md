# Mathbox — universal original-X primitive algebraic correspondence and all-rank spectral native-birth attack

**2026-10-18. Base:** c593e5a4c9828072cf3a9cf3c7c1c8d87d65f985. **Target unchanged:** for arbitrary smooth projective complex original X, every p and rational (p,p) alpha, independently construct an actual Z in CH^p(X)_Q with the genuine canonical singular-Betti cycle class alpha. The new object constructed here is an ORIGINAL-X **algebraic correspondence in CH^n(X×X)_Q**, not a codimension-p original-X representative; do not conflate them.

## Route A — all-X actual algebraic primitive diagonal, with no target cycle as input

Let X be smooth projective of complex dimension n>0. Embed X by a sufficiently ample L, then take a basepoint-free general linear projection f:X→P^n, finite surjective of degree d>0. Because X is smooth Cohen–Macaulay and P^n is regular, a finite equidimensional f is flat. Its graph Γ_f⊂X×P^n is genuine algebraic; transposition and proper algebraic correspondence composition give the true codimension-n fiber-product correspondence

\[
 W_f={}^t\Gamma_f\circ\Gamma_f=[X\times_{\mathbb P^n}X]\in CH^n(X\times X)_{\mathbb Q}.
\]

Define the actual *algebraic* projector correspondence, with NO Hodge witness as input,

\[
\boxed{\Pi_f:=[\Delta_X]-\tfrac1d W_f\in CH^n(X\times X)_{\mathbb Q}.}
\]

Its action on rational Betti cohomology (after genuine graph fundamental-class/Gysin comparison) is exactly \((\Pi_f)_*=I-\frac1d f^*f_*\). Since \(f_*f^*=dI\), this operator is idempotent, kills all classes \(f^*H^{2p}(\mathbb P^n,\mathbb Q)=\mathbb Q h^p\), and fixes \(\ker f_*:H^{2p}(X,\mathbb Q)\to H^{2p}(\mathbb P^n,\mathbb Q)\). In particular any middle primitive rational Hodge class alpha with 2p<=n and p>=1 satisfies \(f_*\alpha=0\) by the primitive relation \(\alpha h^{n-2p+1}=0\), hence \(\Pi_{f*}\alpha=\alpha\). The entire algebraic correspondence is already present on the ORIGINAL X×X for **every X**, independent of whether alpha is algebraic.

Let \(\alpha\ne0\) be rational primitive of type (p,p), 2p<=n, and let Q be the true signed Hodge–Riemann pairing \(Q(\alpha,\alpha)=(-1)^p\int_X\alpha^2 h^{n-2p}>0\). Using the diagonal integration identity and f_*alpha=0 gives the exact **target-sensitive algebraic correspondence readout**

\[
\boxed{(-1)^p \int_{X\times X} [\Pi_f]\,
   \mathrm{pr}_1^*(\alpha h^{n-2p})\,\mathrm{pr}_2^*(\alpha)
   =Q(\alpha,\alpha)>0.}
\]

Thus a genuine algebraic primitive projective-incidence/diagonal object has *nonzero geometric detection of any nonzero primitive alpha on every original X*, without a preexisting codimension-p Chow cycle representing alpha. This is a structural cross-connection of GST diagonal identity, finite-projection native trace-zero surgery, polarized residual energy and Poincare geometry. The cohomological alpha factors in the readout are NOT algebraic inputs. **No single-sided original-X cycle is derived by this identity.**

**Stronger actual Chow-motive birth: \(\Pi_f\) is itself an ALGEBRAIC IDEMPOTENT correspondence, not just an idempotent linear operator.** On the actual finite-flat scheme graph, the composition law \(\Gamma_f\circ{}^t\Gamma_f=d\Delta_{\mathbb P^n}\) holds as a Chow-correspondence identity by the finite flat push/pull degree formula. Hence, with \(W={}^t\Gamma_f\circ\Gamma_f\), one has \(W\circ W=dW\), and therefore
\[
\boxed{\Pi_f\circ\Pi_f=(\Delta_X-W/d)^2=\Pi_f
       \quad\text{in }CH^n(X\times X)_{\mathbb Q}.}
\]
In particular the universal *reduced primitive carrier* \((X,\Pi_f)\) is a true rational Chow-motivic direct summand of \(h(X)\) for EVERY original X. On genuine rational algebraic cycles its action has image \(\ker(f_*:CH^p(X)_{\mathbb Q}\to CH^p(\mathbb P^n)_{\mathbb Q})\); on Betti it has image \(\ker f_*\), because \(f_*f^*=d\) and \(f_* \Pi_f=0\). The prior existing Lean declarations ActualXFiniteProjectiveNativeTrace.nativeTraceZeroProjector, traceZeroNative_idempotent and range_projector_eq_kernel_push already VERIFY the actual native Chow-operator version of these identities; the statement about equality of cycles under full Chow-correspondence composition uses the genuine finite-flat graph identity as a separately specified geometric input, not a hidden formal Lean theorem.

The object now constructed on every X is considerably stronger than a formal world projector: its underlying **codimension-n cycle on X×X exists algebraically**, and its Chow action splits the native primitive sector. A target primitive rational (p,p) alpha belongs to its actual Betti realization. Producing a codimension-p native cycle with that specific class still requires an algebraic *point/vector* in the motive's weight-p Chow group; the idempotent motive's existence alone does not create that vector.

**Exact original-X cubic-fourfold test:** For smooth cubic fourfold X containing plane P, d=3, f_*h²=3H², f_*[P]=H², so \(\Pi_{f*}h²=0\) and \(\Pi_{f*}[P]=[P]-h²/3\). In the actual intersection Gram [[3,1],[1,3]], \(([P]-h²/3)^2=8/3\), agreeing with the prior GST primitive residual. The projector is an actual rational combination of algebraic correspondences on the original X and has a nonzero primitive response.

**Critical source-extraction demand:** an algebraic class on X×X does NOT yield an algebraic codimension-p class on X by contracting one factor with an arbitrary rational Hodge alpha; that contraction is merely a rational cohomology operation. A genuine all-X source theorem must construct an *algebraic* factorization/slicing of Pi_f with nonzero alpha-coupling. Replacing the cohomological alpha in the above pairing by a presupposed Chow class would insert the target into the hypothesis. This is the precise native-source operation left for geometric work, not a newly introduced axiom.

## Route B — upgraded GST arbitrary-rank spectral correspondence determinant

Let T be a genuine algebraic correspondence inducing a rational Hodge operator, Q-self-adjoint on a chosen positive primitive sector. If T has distinct rational eigenvalues \(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_s\) and an actual native source v has nonzero Q-orthogonal eigenprojections \(v_k\), put \(w_k=Q(v_k,v_k)>0\). All Hodge moments are

\[
m_j=Q(v,T^j v)=\sum_{k=1}^s w_k\lambda_k^j.
\]

Consequently the s×s GST Krylov moment matrix H_{ij}=m_{i+j} factorizes as \(H=A^{\mathsf T}\operatorname{diag}(w)A\) with A_{kj}=\lambda_k^j. Thus

\[
\boxed{\det H=(\prod_{k=1}^s w_k)
              \prod_{1\le i<j\le s}(\lambda_j-\lambda_i)^2>0.}
\]

This **removes a bare determinant nonzero hypothesis** from the old GST geometric-Krylov criterion, reducing it to separated actual correspondence eigenvalues and positive geometrically calculated seed weights. Wolfram verified the polynomial identity EXACTLY at s=1,2,3,4. The existing Lean file GSTClassicalHodgeGeometricKrylovMomentDeterminant.lean was edited in place with gstSpectralPowerMatrix, gstSpectralMomentMatrix, gstSpectralMoment_det_factor and gstSpectralMoment_det_nonzero; a dedicated GitHub workflow checks the file; its final CI receipt must be explicitly confirmed before promotion to kernel-verified.

**Operator obstruction test on the actual all-X projector from Route A.** Since \(\Pi_f^2=\Pi_f\), its only rational eigenvalues are 0 and 1. A single-generator Krylov Hankel matrix of rank s>=3 has duplicate rows and determinant identically zero. Wolfram EXACT calculations: for eigenvalue lists {0,1,1} and {0,1,1,1} the determinants are 0 for arbitrary weights; for {0,1,2} the determinant is 4abc. This proves that the universal algebraic primitive projector, although a genuine all-X *detector*, CANNOT ALONE supply a high-dimensional cyclic algebraic generating action. New genuinely richer algebraic correspondences or several distinct geometric sources are mathematically essential for this specific spectral mechanism.

Wolfram caveat: evaluating 0^0 natively can produce Indeterminate. Tests explicitly used exponent-zero value 1, the algebraically correct polynomial convention, and then found exact symbolic determinants; no floating tolerance or data fitting.

## Route B2 — CM–NM spectral energy beyond rational real eigenvalues

The generic moment-factorization \(\det(A^\top\operatorname{diag}(w)A)=(\det A)^2\prod w_k\) is a polynomial identity over ANY characteristic-zero splitting field, not just the rational values implemented in the new Lean spectral proof. Since an actual GST correspondence has rational matrix entries, its rational Hankel determinant is nonzero if its extension to the splitting field is nonzero. However non-real CM eigenvalues are incompatible with a positive *real self-adjoint* operator, and a complex eigenvector's symmetric bilinear self-pairing may vanish. Therefore the rational-real positive-weight spectral theorem CANNOT simply be invoked for the non-real CM action; this is an important exact type distinction.

For the true **quadratic CM geometry** already present in GSTCMQuadraticNativeRankForcing.lean, the correct geometric test is real and stronger. Let Q be a positive symmetric rational primitive polarization, let \(J^2=-I\) and \(Q(Ju,v)=-Q(u,Jv)\), and let the ACTUAL native correspondence act as \(T=aI+bJ\) with rational \(b\ne0\). For any genuine native v with \(g=Q(v,v)>0\),

\[
Q(v,Tv)=ag,\qquad Q(Tv,Tv)=(a^2+b^2)g.
\]

Thus the actual rational **Gram determinant of two native orbit classes** is

\[
\boxed{
\det\begin{pmatrix}Q(v,v)&Q(v,Tv)\\Q(Tv,v)&Q(Tv,Tv)\end{pmatrix}
=b^2g^2>0.
}
\]

This both avoids complex eigenvector positivity errors and constructs the independent second geometric direction from one real native source and one genuine non-real CM operator. Wolfram verified the exact determinant \(b^2g^2\) and its strict positivity for real g>0, b!=0. In a two-dimensional primitive rational sector this completes native generation **when the source and geometric CM action are actually realized**; in rank>2 a single quadratic action has insufficient minimal-polynomial degree, as Route C establishes.

The next constructive question is whether GST can produce from the original-X universal primitive motive \((X,\Pi_f)\) either (i) a native nonzero primitive seed and a suitable CM-type noncommuting correspondence action, or (ii) an algebraic one-sided slice of its primitive diagonal. Neither is supplied by spectral arithmetic alone. These are precise geometric construction obligations, not extra axioms or formal "energy" assumptions.

## Route C — exact universal GST correspondence complexity bound

A single algebraic correspondence operator T with minimal polynomial
\[
m_T(t)=t^r+c_{r-1}t^{r-1}+\cdots+c_0
\]
gives, for ANY native seed v and ANY linear geometric readout ell, the scalar moments \(a_k=\ell(T^kv)\). Because \(m_T(T)=0\), they satisfy for EVERY k>=0 the exact recurrence
\[
a_{k+r}=-\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}c_j a_{k+j}.
\]
Therefore every column of the \(n\times n\) Hankel matrix \(H_{ij}=a_{i+j}\) with index j>=r is a linear combination of its first r columns, and
\[
\boxed{\operatorname{rank}H\le r,\qquad
 n>r\Longrightarrow\det H=0.}
\]

This is an ALL-rank theorem for every actual original-X cycle-class operator, independent of spectra, eigenbasis, or positivity. It proves precisely why the actual arbitrary-X Chow projector Pi_f (minimal polynomial divides t(t-1), r<=2) cannot by itself build cyclic native generators when the target Hodge dimension exceeds two. The true GST upgrade cannot merely iterate an idempotent world-birth or multiply the number of internal coordinates; it must provide a genuinely higher-degree realized geometric action, several independent noncommuting actions with larger joint operator span, or directly new native sources.

This rank bound was proved algebraically by the displayed recurrence (not by checking finite matrices). The Wolfram 3×3 and 4×4 idempotent tests are finite checks only. It is a structural law about *single-operator saturation*, not evidence against the Hodge conjecture.

## Program status and research move

What is independently constructed on EVERY original X here: the rational primitive diagonal correspondence Pi_f and its nonzero target-sensitive pairing for every nonzero primitive rational (p,p) alpha (analytic comparison subject to standard fundamental-class naturality). What is algebraically proved for an arbitrary-rank correspondence moment: exact spectral/Vandermonde factorization and determinant positivity under actual separated spectrum and positive source components. These are substantive new *cross-law* sources and numerical invariants, not universal Hodge-cycle representatives.

**The next decisive geometric construction** is a real algebraic factorization of Pi_f on the appropriate primitive Hodge sector, or an independently built native seed with positive weight in each sector of a non-idempotent genuinely algebraic correspondence on X. Neither can be assumed merely from the existence of Pi_f or from its target-sensitive Betti pairing. Canonical cycle-class comparison remains a separate proof obligation in the current Lean structures.

No local Lean setup or web search; actual source and workflow updates were performed through the GitHub connector, with exact Wolfram computations.
