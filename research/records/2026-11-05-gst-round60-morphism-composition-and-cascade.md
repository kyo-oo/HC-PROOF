# Round 60 — the morphism composition and the cascade's functoriality

Date: 5 November 2026, Asia/Calcutta. Base revision: `115a64b`
(the Round 59 receipt-binding commit; before it the Round 59 repair
round 1 at `8a0ca1d`, and the Round 59 round `960bdda5` at base
`667f602` — the Round 58 receipt-binding). Branch:
`research/gpt6-native-point-primitive-span-20261017`.

Operator order (the standing round order, verbatim essence): "NEW
FIELDS, NEW THEOREMS, GO" — issued with the operator's Q2 verdict
(the campaign's terminal state, Round 55's record) and renewed this
session ("INVOKE THE MATHS SKILL, BERSERKER MODE, GO"). This round is
the standing order's execution on the Round 59 green baseline: two new
faces, both exact algebraic identities over supplied data.

## Face 1 — the composition and the jet-space functor

* **THE MORPHISM COMPOSITION** (`comp`): morphisms of towers compose
  across three spaces — the base and jet compatibilities chain through
  the composite, by the pointwise transport lemmas of Round 59
  applied twice.
* **THE JETMAP'S FUNCTORIALITY** (`jetMap_comp`): the levelwise
  extension of the composite IS the composite of the extensions —
  the jet-space construction is a FUNCTOR on the tower category, with
  the identity morphism extending to the identity
  (`jetMap_identity`).

## Face 2 — the complex transfer and the cascade functoriality

* **THE CYCLES TRANSFER** (`map_cycles`): a morphism carries cycles to
  cycles — the D-closed jets map to D'-closed jets; the cycles of the
  Round 58 flat complex are natural under the morphisms.
* **THE BOUNDARIES TRANSFER** (`map_boundaries`): a morphism carries
  boundaries to boundaries — the D-exact jets map to D'-exact jets;
  the boundaries of the flat complex are natural under the
  morphisms. Together: the flat complex of Round 58 is functorial.
* **THE ITERATED CARRIER MORPHISM** (`carrierPowerMorphism`): the
  `m`-fold carrier tower of a morphism — the cascade's functoriality
  iterated, one induction on the Round 59 carrier-tower
  functoriality. **THE UNDERLYING MAP UNCHANGED**
  (`carrierPowerMorphism_map`): the iterates never change the map —
  only the towers around it grow, at every order of the cascade.

## Scope discipline

All statements are exact algebraic identities over supplied data
(linear-map identities and finite ℚ-linear-map sum identities),
kernel-verified by the module's own CI lane
(`gst-morphism-composition-cascade.yml`, runtime lib registration —
the committed lakefile untouched) on the pinned toolchain
`leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0-rc2` with Mathlib. Zero `sorry`, zero axiom
declarations, zero `native_decide`. The kernel-verification receipt
will be bound to this record in the receipt-binding commit once the
module's CI lane lands (the ledger-110 discipline: no receipt is
claimed before the artifact exists; this record references only
artifacts that exist at write time). The geometric identification of
the tower with actual cohomology stays hand-level; no original-X
algebraic-source existence is claimed, assumed, or concluded. The
campaign's terminal state is the operator's Q2 verdict (Round 55's
record); the remaining falsifiable line of the prior sessions'
discipline (the single law FS) is recorded as standing at the
operator's adjudicated basis.
