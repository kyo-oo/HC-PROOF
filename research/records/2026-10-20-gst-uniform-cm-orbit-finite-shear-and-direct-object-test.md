The universal construction and a genuine Hodge counterexample were not obtained. The new results below remove a finite exponent restriction, upgrade a first-order identity to an exact parameter identity, and identify a specific nonzero object-level obstruction rather than inferring deformation from Chern cancellation.

## 1. The post-handoff mathematics that controls this continuation

| Existing progress | Strongest usable result | Relevant source |
|---|---|---|
| Original-X mixed K0 source birth | Arbitrary finite incidence/Koszul factors, with the correct leading Chow grade and relative Todd correction | `GSTUniversalResolvedSupportHodge.lean` |
| Quadric-center blowup | Actual exceptional surface difference has primitive norm 2; the full Hodge ranks and algebraic ranks are both `(1,2,3,2,1)` | [Blowup audit](2026-10-19-quadric-blowup-rational-hodge-counterexample-audit.md) |
| GST cosmology | Genuine split births preserve missing source directions; codimension-two blowup canonical cycle blocks are onto exactly when their base and center blocks are onto | `GSTGraphV2SelfExpandingCosmology.lean` |
| Actual geometric operators | Bare geometric raising/lowering words cannot rotate a joint middle-primitive vector; projective-degree moments vanish on its invariant primitive orbit | `GSTClassicalHodgeRankFreeLefschetzPoincareGeneration.lean` |
| Secant extraction | A genuine ordinary sheaf with the specified Betti character yields a Chow source on the original fourfold; the relative sheaf construction is a separate input | `GSTWeilFourfoldAuxiliaryExtraction.lean` |
| CM projector and incidence | Three genuine CM operators give the 19,200-denominator frame; opposite-sign bare graph Ext3 has a parity obstruction; neutral auxiliary incidence provides candidate Ext2 arrows | `GSTUniversalCMArithmeticObstruction.lean` |
| Corrected full-kernel incidence | The component-aware capacities are 35 or 120, with connected numerical rank **144**, superseding the older symmetric-35 minimum 150 as the sharper model | `cmWeilSixfoldFullKernelLCI_connected_rank_144` and `_connected_rank_feasible` |
| Smaller integral Weil source | Two explicit four-product integral Chow expressions and pure perfect-K0 lifts at the split CM fibre; full Gram `-32 I2`; a simple pure representative would have Ext2 dimension at least 15 | [Integral source](2026-10-20-gst-four-divisor-integral-weil-k0-source.md), [full lattice](2026-10-20-gst-integral-weil-lattice-gram-and-deformation-no-go.md) |
| Latest mixed tangent test | Both complete first-order Weil variations factor through two exterior-repetition annihilators | `cmWeilCMIntegralMixedLeakFactorization`, `_MixedLeakVanishes` |

This mapping preserves the existing route. In particular, rank 144 is a numerical capacity certificate, not an already constructed semiregular family, and the primitive-integral source should not be confused with the older 4,800-scaled graph numerator.

## 2. A uniform CM channel, replacing the six-offset bound

Write

\[
(2+i)^n=a_n+i b_n,\qquad
(a_{n+1},b_{n+1})=(2a_n-b_n,a_n+2b_n).
\]

The existing definition is `cmTwoPlusIGaussianPower`. For every n, the new induction proves

\[
a_n+2b_n\equiv1\text{ or }4\pmod5.
\]

For every positive exponent,

\[
a_n-2b_n\equiv0\pmod5.
\]

The second assertion follows immediately from
`(2a-b)-2(a+2b)=-5b`; the first follows because the next unit channel is congruent to four times the previous one. If b_n were zero, both channels would coincide, a contradiction. If a_n were zero, the channels would be negatives of one another, again a contradiction. Thus

\[
\boxed{a_n\ne0,\quad b_n\ne0\quad\text{for every }n\ge1.}
\]

The n=0 exclusion is necessary: b_0=0. The formal declarations are:

- `cmTwoPlusIGaussianPower_modFive_unit`;
- `cmTwoPlusIGaussianPower_modFive_zero`;
- `cmTwoPlusIGaussianPower_imag_nonzero`;
- `cmTwoPlusIGaussianPower_real_nonzero`.

The previous `_imag_nonzero_to_six` now follows from the uniform theorem instead of six separate evaluations. `cmWeilAllPositiveWeightOneSourceReconstruction` then reuses the existing exact Cramer compiler with the actual coefficients a_n,b_n; it needs no additional premise `b_n != 0`. For a genuine Weil `(p,p)` plane use its even exterior weight n=2p. It still needs an independently constructed nonzero native source and the true canonical isogeny comparison; arithmetic does not supply that source.

## 3. Exact finite mixed shear, including its quadratic term

Define the two existing four-divisor source expressions by

\[
R=-a_1a_2a_3+a_1b_2b_3+b_1a_2b_3+b_1b_2a_3,
\]
\[
I=b_1a_2a_3+a_1b_2a_3+a_1a_2b_3-b_1b_2b_3.
\]

Use the same mixed shear as the preceding theorem:

\[
a_1(t)=a_1+td_1,\quad b_1(t)=b_1+itd_1,\qquad
a_2(t)=a_2+td_2,\quad b_2(t)=b_2-itd_2.
\]

Keep a_3,b_3 fixed. In **any commutative ring**, with L_R,L_I the complete previously defined first-order variations, the exact identities are

\[
R(t)-R(0)=tL_R-(i^2+1)t^2d_1d_2a_3,
\]
\[
I(t)-I(0)=tL_I+(i^2+1)t^2d_1d_2b_3.
\]

There are no higher terms. The minus sign in the real quadratic term matters and was independently checked in Wolfram. Combining this exact expansion with

\[
i^2=-1,\qquad d_1(a_2-ib_2)=0,\qquad d_2(a_1+ib_1)=0
\]

and the existing complete first-order factorization gives

\[
\boxed{R(t)=R(0),\qquad I(t)=I(0)\quad\text{for every scalar }t.}
\]

Formal declarations: `cmWeilCMIntegralMixedShearExpansion` and `cmWeilCMIntegralMixedShearInvariant`. This is stronger than a vanishing derivative. Its geometric application is to the specified two-form substitution in the complexified even Betti algebra, where the two annihilators come from exterior repetition. It does not assert that the individual factors remain algebraic divisors at moved periods, that every scalar parameter is a positive polarized period, or that a relative perfect object has been constructed.

## 4. Direct check of the actual split representative's obstruction

Let Q_Aj be the previously constructed integral perfect-K0 class

\[
Q_{A_j}=[L_{A_j}]-[\mathcal O_{S_j}]+[\mathcal O_{p_j}].
\]

Consider the **unmodified signed-direct-sum/shift representative** of the real source R. Its term `-Q_A1 tensor Q_A2 tensor Q_A3` contains the actual shifted line bundle

\[
L[1],\qquad
L=L_{A_1}\boxtimes L_{A_2}\boxtimes L_{A_3},
\quad c_1(L)=A_1+A_2+A_3.
\]

With the repository's holomorphic forms u_j,v_j and antiholomorphic forms U_j,V_j,

\[
A_j=(u_j\wedge V_j+U_j\wedge v_j)/2.
\]

Along the named tangent `u1(t)=u1+t V2`, `v2(t)=v2+t U1`, express the fixed class in the moved holomorphic basis. Its `(0,2)` variation is

\[
\delta c_1(L)=-\tfrac12(V_2\wedge V_1+U_2\wedge U_1)
=\tfrac12(V_1\wedge V_2+U_1\wedge U_2)\ne0.
\]

The two displayed exterior monomials are independent in the genuine complex torus's H2(O). The standard line-bundle Atiyah/Kodaira-Spencer identification therefore gives `At(L) contracted with kappa != 0`.

This detects the actual direct-sum object, not merely its Chern trace. If j and p are the inclusion and retraction of its summand L[1], Atiyah naturality gives

\[
p[2]\circ\operatorname{ob}(F_R)\circ j
=\operatorname{ob}(L[1])\ne0.
\]

Hence the **unmodified split direct-sum representative** cannot deform along this tangent, even though its full pure Weil character has the exact cancellation in section 3. Shift conventions can change a sign but cannot make this summand's obstruction zero. A genuinely coupled different representative of the same K0 class is not excluded by this argument.

The exterior coefficients are computed from the forms by the reproducible script, rather than entered as a desired answer. The scheme-level Atiyah comparison and derived naturality in this paragraph are mathematical geometric inputs, not newly instantiated Lean structures. This is a self-audited object-specific derivation, not a Hodge counterexample.

## 5. Executed evidence and next exact construction

The [standard-library exact script](../computations/gst_weil_uniform_power_and_shear.py) multiplies sparse rational polynomials, verifies both full shear remainders are zero, checks the earlier leak factorization independently, compares the linear Gaussian recurrence with binary Gaussian exponentiation for **every n=1,...,512**, checks the norm 5^n and both mod-five channels, and computes the line-bundle exterior variation from the stated shear. Its [output](../computations/gst_weil_uniform_power_and_shear.output.json) and [version-2 manifest](../computations/gst_weil_uniform_power_and_shear.manifest.json) pin the inputs and bounds. The finite exponent test supports the implementation; the Lean induction proves the unrestricted statement.

Wolfram independently returned the two quadratic coefficients
`-(1+i^2)*a3*d1*d2` and `+(1+i^2)*b3*d1*d2`, zero corrected polynomial remainders, and the channel identity `a'-2b'=-5b`. An exploratory check initially tested the wrong sign for the real quadratic term; its nonzero remainder identified that mistake before the correct formula was committed. The Lean ring proof and separate Python polynomial arithmetic agree with the corrected signs.

**Nearest unresolved implication:** construct a genuinely coupled perfect object in the smaller integral Weil K0 class and show that its actual `At(F) contracted with kappa` vanishes, with the required canonical Betti comparison. The split direct sum cannot be used for this step. The corrected 144-rank incidence candidate remains an alternative existing constructor whose whole dg differential and Atiyah class require an object-level calculation. A sheaf that is only supplied by a period-spread assumption cannot discharge the obligation.

**Counterexample route:** the existing quadric blowup and smooth known-center blowup decompositions do not create a nonalgebraic Hodge class. On the nonsplit Weil candidate, a true disproof still requires proving that the projected canonical Chow image is zero for **all** algebraic cycles; neither this object's obstruction nor divisor-sector failure proves that.

**Continuation disposition:** arithmetic and finite-shear sub-obligations proved; the explicit direct-sum deformation subroute refuted for the named tangent; genuinely coupled object and arbitrary-original-X source routes remain open. Preserve the all-X target and attack this object-level step rather than repeating the character cancellation or lowering another numerical incidence budget.
