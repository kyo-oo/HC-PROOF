**Date:** 2026-11-10. **Based directly on owner's three uploaded images** (aleph-indexed cycle/topology universe, uncountable Hodge sum, C=aleph-infinity times tau_n, GST N-cohomology, Hodge star, curvature, navigation).

## 1. Keep the owner's idea while fixing the mathematics

There are THREE independent carriers:
- Natural-number n in N: ordinary fold iteration, with N^0=id, not zero.
- Ordinal alpha<kappa: a stage/address (possibly a limit ordinal); no meaning for N^alpha is supplied by ordinary N-cohomology alone.
- Cardinal kappa: size of a family of geometric worlds. The conventional first limit of aleph_0, aleph_1,... is aleph_omega, not an unqualified "aleph_infinity"; alpha<omega_1 indexes all countable ordinals, not the same collection as {aleph_n:n<omega}.

Topology tau_alpha is a TopologicalSpace on a Point fiber; it is not a number that may simply be multiplied by a cardinal. The correctly typed topological carrier is the disjoint union of (Point_alpha,tau_alpha) across alpha<kappa. Individual smooth projective varieties remain finite-dimensional finite-type objects; arbitrary cardinal/fiber sets can still be indexed.

An uncountable summation S=sum_{alpha<omega_1} c_alpha ell_alpha in rational Chow/Hodge modules requires FINITE SUPPORT unless a separately defined convergence/completion is proved. The user's A=direct sum becomes the honest rational tagged cycle/Hodge modules
A_kappa = direct sum_{a<kappa} CH^{p_a}(X_a)_Q,
W_kappa = direct sum_{a<kappa} Hdg^{p_a}(X_a),
cl_kappa = direct sum cl_{X_a,p_a}.
No coercion of different weights, dimensions, Betti types, or topologies.

**Exact theorem, any cardinal:** if true native/Betti folds satisfy cl_a N_a = T_a cl_a in each actual world, then their finite-support direct sums satisfy cl_kappa N_kappa^n = T_kappa^n cl_kappa for all n in N. This is a formal fiberwise lemma with no automatic all-Hodge algebraicity.

**Exact conservation theorem:** coker(cl_kappa) = direct sum coker(cl_a); cl_kappa onto iff every cl_a onto. Reindexing cannot fill missing algebraicity.

## 2. True Chow/Hodge geometry in ALL dimensions of the product test family

Let X_d=(P1)^d, d any finite positive integer. Write h_i for the hyperplane divisor on factor i. The exact Chow and rational even Betti/Hodge ring is Q[h_1,...,h_d]/(h_i^2), with h_i actual algebraic cycles.

At codimension p, the basis consists of h_I=product_{i in I}h_i, I subset [d], |I|=p, cardinal r=binomial(d,p). All are (p,p) Hodge classes; Kunneth/projective-bundle formula gives the full Hodge space. Their EXACT Poincare duals are h_{I^c}; integral h_J h_{I^c} = delta_{I,J}.

**New explicit full cycle correspondence:** for p-subsets I,J,
E_{I,J} = pr_1^* h_{I^c} pr_2^* h_J in CH^d(X_d x X_d)_Q,
which acts on true Chow and true Betti by E_{I,J}(h_K)=delta_{I,K} h_J. Choose any cyclic order I_1,...,I_r and set Gamma_{d,p} = sum_{j=1}^r E_{I_j,I_{j+1}}, I_{r+1}=I_1. This is a GENUINE algebraic codimension-d Chow correspondence, with seed h_{I_1}, orbit h_{I_1},...,h_{I_r}, and the rational Poincare detector ell(alpha)=integral alpha h_{I_1^c}. The Hankel determinant is EXACTLY (-1)^((r-1)(r-2)/2), nonzero for **every finite d and p**. No unknown Hodge-to-Chow inverse was input; these are varieties whose Chow/Hodge ring is independently known.

The user's P1 x P1 compression must keep BOTH coordinates: alpha = a H1 + b H2. A map (a,b)->a+b has kernel (1,-1) and cannot represent an arbitrary Hodge class faithfully. A finite-support, tagged Q^2 or complement-pairing preserves the structure.

**Hodge-star realization:** with the normalized Kähler product metric on (P1)^d, analytic Hodge star sends the harmonic monomial h_I to h_{I^c}; the star-square is 1 on this even-cohomological basis. The true algebraic duals in E_{I,J} are exactly the Hodge-star complements. Do NOT claim analytic Hodge star of general X is an automatically realized algebraic Chow operator.

**Wolfram:** research/computations/GST_cardinal_Hodge_star_product_tower_20261110.wl was fetched from GitHub after commit and executed exactly. Every one of 27 cases (d=1,..,6, p=0,..,d), including rank 20 at d=6,p=3, has exact orbit rank r, cyclic Krylov determinant +1, signed Hankel determinant, and star complement isometry. Scalar-compression test detected the nonzero kernel. Result allPassed -> True. The all-finite-d theorem follows from the above general proof, NOT finite extrapolation.

## 3. GST world graph and cardinal navigation

Real morphisms connect the original varieties: q_d:X_{d+1}->X_d forgets the last P1 factor; section s_d inserts a chosen point; s_d^* q_d^* = id on Chow and Betti. The directed colimit of their rational Chow rings is the finite-polynomial ring Q[h_1,h_2,...]/(h_i^2); it is NOT a Chow ring of a fixed infinite-dimensional finite-type smooth projective variety.

Define navigation shift nu(h_i)=h_{i+1}. At each finite stage it is induced by a genuine inter-stage morphism X_{d+1}->X_d dropping the first coordinate. Thus the first divisor h1 has orbit h1,h2,... under a REAL geometric inter-stage operator. This does not supply an endomorphism of a fixed original X_d. For codimension p>1, the simultaneous shift of all indices preserves gaps, and does not generate all basis p-subsets; use true finite-stage matrix units instead. Finite-stage cyclic folds generally fail to commute with stabilization inclusions at their boundary, so there is no silent single endomorphism of the ind-tower.

The graph vertices are tagged (d,p,I); stabilization edges (d,p,I)->(d+1,p,I), navigation edges (d,p,I)->(d+1,p,I+1), and true matrix-unit edges (d,p,I)->(d,p,J). Every finite edge comes from an actual geometric map or algebraic correspondence. These make the family navigable but do not solve Hodge on arbitrary X.

## 4. Original-X arbitrary-variety Pascal deficit theorem: new precise universal algebra

For *any* smooth projective complex X of dimension m define
D_p(X)=Hdg^p(X)/im(cl_X^p), delta_p=dim_Q D_p(X), and D_X(t)=sum_p delta_p t^p.
By Chow projective-bundle formula, Betti Kunneth, Hodge grading and cycle-class multiplicativity, for Y_d=X x (P1)^d:
D_p(Y_d) ~= direct sum_{J subset [d]} D_{p-|J|}(X),
delta_p(Y_d) = sum_{j=0}^d binomial(d,j) delta_{p-j}(X).
Equivalently **D_{Y_d}(t)=(1+t)^d D_X(t)**. In particular Hodge holds for Y_d iff it holds for X. This is a rigorous universal-X cardinal/dimension upgrade, but it is a *conservation/propagation theorem*, not a proof that the deficits are zero.

Exact symbolic Wolfram source research/computations/GST_cardinal_projective_stabilization_defect_20261110.wl returned allPassed -> True for general symbolic coefficients dd[0]..dd[5] and every tested d=0..8. Hypothetically one missing weight-2 class would propagate at d=4 as t^2+4t^3+6t^4+4t^5+t^6, not disappear. The formula is proved for all d via the projective bundle theorem, not inferred from finite symbolic checks.

## 5. Limit-ordinal source cannot be silently created by ordinary finite fold iteration

Let kappa>omega be a limit ordinal and let V=Q^(kappa) be the finite-support space with basis e_alpha. Define successor fold S e_alpha=e_(alpha+1). From e0, the entire *ordinary* polynomial orbit is span{e_n:n<omega}. In particular e_omega is NOT in this span and not in its coordinatewise closure in Q^kappa, since the omega-coordinate projection is continuous and always zero on the polynomial orbit.

A genuine transfinite GST source-birth law needs a separately constructed NATIVE limit-stage cycle and proof of its canonical Betti image, or an honestly defined and validated completion/limit operation. Ordinary n=0,1,2,... powers of an operator do not define N^(aleph_0) or N^omega. No counterexample to the Hodge conjecture is asserted; this is a precise obstruction to the proposed cardinal-iteration shortcut.

## 6. Lean-checked no-escape criterion and research target

New additive file GSTCardinalIndexedNativeHodge.lean imports the original GSTGeneralSpace and Mathlib, defines arbitrary-cardinal typed fibers with topology, rational finite-support packets, and proves cycle-class naturality of the ordinary fold at each cardinal tag. It proves:
- native_retraction_reflects_algebraicity;
- missing_native_class_survives_retract;
- finite_correspondence_sum_natural;
- cardinal_family_orbit_natural.

The actual GitHub Actions run 42821152363 for SHA 4e31eb70e460cabe435da4917d1274529859f515 completed SUCCESS and checked for sorryAx. This formalization proves the abstract typed transfer/retract statements. It does NOT formalize the projective bundle/Hodge star analytic geometry or construct general universal Chow correspondences.

Prior GST modules directly relevant: GSTGeneralSpace (dimension-free ontology), GSTGeneralSpaceCohomology (native image no-escape under reversible transport), GSTWorldCosmology (CompactCosmos versus CompletedCosmos), GSTGraphV2SelfExpandingCosmology (arbitrary-arity indexed births, but Birth is a separate certified input), GSTGraphV2UnboundedHigherCausality (all finite higher-causality levels), GSTHodgeWaveAllNHoleReadout (all N-shape finite wave channels), GSTHodgeSingleHypothesisConditional (the existing conditional Hodge implication).

**Remaining universal original-X assertion:** For every smooth projective complex X and every p, independently construct a genuine original-X algebraic GST operator/seed whose canonical Hodge orbit has rank dim_Q Hdg^p(X), or provide a genuine finite family of native source births reaching that rank without assuming target preimages. A cardinal-indexed mechanism that simply reconstructs a source from the assumed existence of algebraic lifts would be circular. For each fixed X,p the required rank is FINITE; any truly spanning transfinite family contains a finite subfamily of at most that rank.

**Evidence status:** Cardinal world formalism and naturality proved (Lean); all-finite-d cyclic correspondence on the P1-product family proved in usual Chow geometry (Wolfram corroboration); original-X Pascal algebraicity-deficit theorem proved via projective bundle formula (Wolfram corroboration); arbitrary original-X genuine source-birth/full cyclicity remains open.
