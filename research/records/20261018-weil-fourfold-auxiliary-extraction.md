## Exact result and its dependency

There is an explicit Chow-theoretic extraction

\[
 Z=(p_A)_*\bigl(\Gamma\cdot p_B^*(\Delta-F_1-F_2)\bigr)
      \in\mathrm{CH}^2(A)_{\mathbb Q}
 \tag{1}
\]

which sends EVERY nonzero rational Weil class of a suitable auxiliary
sixfold to a nonzero exceptional Weil class of the ORIGINAL fourfold A.
It requires no discriminant-one hypothesis on A. This is a geometric
reduction using an external source theorem, not a GST-only construction
of the sixfold cycle and not a complete Lean formalization.

The named external input is:

**T6.** For every imaginary quadratic field K, the rational Weil plane
of every complex abelian sixfold with compatible hyperbolic Hermitian
polarization of signature (3,3) consists of algebraic codimension-three
classes, at every period, including product periods.

The exact statement occurs as `p3sw:weil-plane` in OpenAI,
*Weil classes and Hodge classes on abelian powers*, October 6, 2026.

The statement, conventions, applicability to products, padding argument,
and relevant source-construction passages were read directly. The entire
external proof was not independently audited or formalized here. Attempts
to open the cited arXiv v2 and published DOI directly were unavailable;
those citations are not separately authenticated by this record.

The source's `p3ab:determinant-supply` already uses elliptic padding and
determinant extraction. Thus this is an explicit specialization and
detector calculation for that mechanism; no novelty claim is made.

## 1. Pad the given fourfold, not a substitute fourfold

Let A be the given polarized complex abelian fourfold of Weil type
for K=Q(u), u^2=-d, d a positive integer. Let the K-action on H^1
have signature (2,2). Use the homological Hermitian convention

\[
 h_A(v,w)=e_A(v,uw)+u e_A(v,w),
\]

conjugate-linear in the first argument. In a K-basis let
delta=det(h_A)>0. Its representative depends on that basis, which is
harmless because the auxiliary polarization is chosen after the basis.

Choose a CM elliptic curve E with K contained in End^0(E), and use the
chosen and conjugate K-actions on its two copies. Put B=E_+ x E_- and
X=A x B. Positive rational rescaling of elliptic polarizations permits
the rank-one Hermitian coefficients

\[
 t,\qquad -\frac{1}{\delta t},\qquad t>0.
\]

The product form on X has signature (3,3) and determinant -1. The
rational Hermitian hyperbolicity test in `p3ab:hyperbolic` therefore
makes it hyperbolic. That test uses Meyer's theorem; it is an external
number-theoretic leaf, not a determinant calculation alone. Clearing
denominators makes the product polarization integral. Its determinant
changes by a sixth power, which is a K/Q norm, so hyperbolicity persists.
All this changes auxiliary polarizations; A itself and its period remain
fixed. The product polarization on B is a positive combination of F1,F2.

Apply T6 to THIS X. Its geometric construction supplies a rational
codimension-three cycle Gamma with

\[
 0\ne \operatorname{cl}_B(\Gamma)\in W_K(X).
 \tag{2}
\]

This is the load-bearing source-existence step. It is supplied by T6,
not inferred from GST coordinates, a class-range retraction, or a
full-rank hypothesis. Without T6 or a replacement geometric proof,
equation (2) remains an unproved obligation in this project.

## 2. An actual algebraic elliptic detector

Write F1=E x {0}, F2={0} x E, Delta for the diagonal, and Gamma_u
for the graph of the integral CM endomorphism u of E. One may choose
E with maximal-order multiplication so u is integral. Define genuine
divisor classes

\[
 D_0=\Delta-F_1-F_2,\qquad
 D_u=\Gamma_u-F_1-dF_2.
\]

Their intersection calculations use the actual elliptic graph numbers:

\[
 F_1F_2=\Delta F_1=\Delta F_2=\Gamma_u F_2=1,\quad
 \Gamma_u F_1=d,\quad \Delta\Gamma_u=\deg(u-1)=d+1,
\]

and all four self-intersections vanish. Consequently

\[
 D_0^2=-2,\qquad D_0D_u=0,\qquad D_u^2=-2d,
 \qquad D_0F_1=D_0F_2=0.                 \tag{3}
\]

On B the total K-action is (u,-u). Its two determinant eigenspaces
in H^2 are of type (1,1). D0 and Du span their rational plane W_K(B).
To see the character convention concretely, on this cross-factor plane
the partial pullback g=(u,id)^* satisfies g(D0)=Du and g(Du)=-d D0
in Betti cohomology. Thus J_B=g has matrix [[0,-d],[1,0]]. These are
cohomological assertions; an arbitrary equality of divisors in the Chow
group is not required.

## 3. The detector cannot lose a nonzero Weil direction

Set V_sigma=H^1(A,K)_sigma and L_sigma=H^1(B,K)_sigma. Their dimensions
are four and two. The natural exterior-product map identifies

\[
 W_K(X)_K=
 (\wedge^4 V_\sigma\otimes\wedge^2 L_\sigma)
 \oplus
 (\wedge^4 V_{\bar\sigma}\otimes\wedge^2 L_{\bar\sigma}). \tag{4}
\]

In particular this lies in H^4(A) tensor H^2(B); no other Kunneth
degrees occur. D0 has nonzero components in both conjugate lines of
W_K(B): it is rational and nonzero by (3), and conjugation exchanges
the two lines. The pairing in (3) is nondegenerate. Hence contraction
with D0 is nonzero on each line in (4), and gives an isomorphism

\[
 c_{D_0}: W_K(X)\longrightarrow W_K(A).       \tag{5}
\]

Here is also a rational coordinate verification, including its signs.
Choose a rational basis A0,A1 of W_K(A) with J_A A0=A1,
J_A A1=-d A0, where J_A has eigenvalues sigma(u),bar-sigma(u) on
the respective determinant lines. In the B basis D0,Du, the equalizer
J_A tensor 1 = 1 tensor J_B consists of the matrices

\[
 M(x,y)=\begin{pmatrix}x&y\\y&-x/d\end{pmatrix}.
\]

This is exactly the rational space in (4). By (3), contraction with
D0 sends M(x,y) to -2x A0 -2y A1. Its determinant in these rational
bases is 4, so a nonzero Weil vector cannot contract to zero. These
coordinates certify the detector; they are not the source cycle.

The polarization on A has one factor of each K embedding. Wedging it
with either fourth exterior eigenspace requires five vectors in a
four-dimensional eigenspace, so W_K(A) is primitive. The same degree
argument identifies the usual Weil classes on X. Also, if a source
character is presented as a theta_X^3+w, equation (3) kills its
polarization-cube term under (1), since theta_X is a product polarization.
For the global application it is safer simply to use the pure cycle
provided by T6; no global deformation of a particular sheaf is presumed.

## 4. Canonical class and actual surface support

Proper pushforward, divisor intersection and external pullback in (1)
are genuine algebraic Chow operations. X has dimension six; intersecting
a codimension-three cycle with one divisor gives codimension four,
and pushing along a relative-dimension-two projection gives codimension
two on A. Functoriality of the ordinary canonical rational Betti cycle
class map and the projection formula give

\[
 \operatorname{cl}_B(Z)=
 (p_A)_*\bigl(\operatorname{cl}_B(\Gamma)\smile p_B^*\operatorname{cl}_B(D_0)\bigr)
 =c_{D_0}(\operatorname{cl}_B(\Gamma))\ne0.      \tag{6}
\]

Thus Z is a rational algebraic source with a nonzero exceptional Weil
class, conditional only on the stated geometric/standard external
inputs. This uses the ordinary canonical map, not an arbitrary Stage-2G
linear map carrying the same name. The repository has not formalized
the identification with that canonical map.

Choose a finite cycle representative of Z, using proper intersections
or the Chow moving lemma as needed. It is a rational combination of
actual integral surfaces on A. If every surface in its support had
zero exceptional projection, (6) would have zero exceptional projection
by linearity. Therefore at least one genuine integral surface in that
support detects an exceptional direction. This existence argument does
not provide equations for a distinguished surface or an algorithm for
finding the Hilbert-scheme parameters in T6. Z is signed; a nonzero
effective primitive middle cycle would have positive ample degree.

## 5. One source supplies the second exceptional direction

For a=m+u, the actual pullback on W_K(A) has eigenvalues a^4,bar(a)^4.
Writing

\[
 r=m^4-6m^2d+d^2,\qquad s=4m(m^2-d),
\]

its rational matrix is r I+s J_A. Choose m=d+1, so
s=4(d+1)(d^2+d+1)>0. For any nonzero v=(x,y),

\[
 \det(v,a^*v)=s(x^2+dy^2)>0.                \tag{7}
\]

Consequently Z and a^*Z have independent exceptional classes. If a
exists only in End^0(A), choose n>0 with f=n a an actual endomorphism
and replace a^*Z by n^(-4) f^*Z. The isogeny f is finite flat, so
this is a genuine rational codimension-two cycle and has the asserted
degree-four Betti action. Pullback preserves the canonical class.

Together with an ample polarization square, these classes span the
three-dimensional rational middle Hodge space in the very general
case described by the user. This conclusion is relative to T6 and
the geometric operations above. Multiplication by u alone would act
on W_K(A) by u^4=d^2 and would NOT supply a second direction; the
non-real fourth power in (7) is essential, including when d=1.

## Verification and remaining work

`GSTWeilFourfoldAuxiliaryExtraction.lean` proves the graph-lattice
identities, the exact balance/contraction calculation, determinant
padding, and (7), universally over rational d>0 where applicable.
It does not formalize abelian varieties, the exterior-cohomology
dictionary, hyperbolicity via Meyer, Chow operations, T6, or the
canonical Betti comparison. There is no axiom asserting a source
cycle in that Lean file.

The Wolfram script `research/computations/weil_fourfold_auxiliary_extraction.wl`
was evaluated with exact symbolic arithmetic. It independently checks
the graph Gram matrix, the two tensor equalizer equations, the derived
extraction matrix, the padded determinant, and the actual fourth-power
character modulo u^2+d. Computation does not prove algebraicity.

The raw output and version-1 manifest are adjacent to the script. The
Mathbox manifest validator accepted the record with its documented legacy
provenance limits. Input SHA-256:

### Adversarial self-review

Primary verdict: **conditional on the named external source theorem T6**,
with a written geometric extraction and separate arithmetic proofs.

| Obligation | Status and evidence |
|---|---|
| Original A retained | Passed: every auxiliary construction is on A x B; the final projection lands on A. |
| Auxiliary signature and discriminant | Determinant identity proved arithmetically; rational Hermitian hyperbolicity uses the stated external Meyer-based test. |
| Nonzero actual sixfold cycle | Conditional external leaf T6, including its product/all-period clause; never a coordinate consequence. |
| Tensor sector and detector | The character and exterior-product derivation is written; rational contraction and graph arithmetic are in the Lean file. |
| Degree and sign of pushforward | Passed on paper: codimension 3+1-2=2; all crossed cohomological degrees are even. |
| Canonical class comparison | Standard Chow/Betti functoriality used explicitly; not implemented by a freely chosen linear map and not Lean formalized. |
| Independence of two Weil outputs | Actual degree-four K character derived; positive determinant calculation in Lean. |
| Three directions exhaust the generic Hodge space | The generic rank-three premise in the user's target is retained; no analogous assertion for arbitrary special periods. |
| Novel GST-only construction or full geometric Lean proof | Not established. |

As a small independent sign and character check, exact integer arithmetic
at d=1 gives (2+u)^4=-7+24u and r^2+d*s^2=625=5^4. At d=2,3,7 the
same norm invariant was checked, as were orbit determinants for vectors
(1,0),(0,1),(1,-2). These checks support the implementation and do not
extend the theorem's geometric scope. The universal arithmetic claims
are the Lean declarations, not this finite sample.

CI for the new arithmetic: [run 39066130937](https://github.com/kyo-oo/HC-PROOF/actions/runs/39066130937)
**PASSED**, at revision `44fd48497a9be20f3e467fafb12cc167da0bb194`.
All eleven theorem declarations kernel checked. The diagnostic prints
report standard axioms only, with no sorryAx; no geometric source axiom
is declared. Artifact ID `12113695466`, ZIP SHA-256:
`6b21837b493d3320e45e985a0f6f852e0b4e1370785b83e1da09fd257c0162e0`.
The earlier run `39065886210` failed to reduce finite-vector coordinates
in two graph calculations. Direct value definitions repaired those
elaboration failures; the contraction and orbit proofs already passed
in that failed aggregate run. Only the final successful run is the
verification receipt for the complete arithmetic file.

The prior directed native-source construction now has a complete
successful Lean receipt: run `39015742539`, revision
`aa2abbe546a6de367c2d970217627bcf0131a7bb`. Both source geometry and
full residual landing passed with no sorryAx. Its artifact SHA-256 is
`13bb5a37b1ff8c5a3e7e9517888124d32bcaf9179f00350bf03df61adfc29a05`.
It does not establish (2).

The GST-only goal and full geometric Lean verification remain OPEN.
The precise next geometric obligation is to construct the nonzero
sixfold source (2) within GST, or formalize and import T6 with its
canonical cycle-class theorem. The padding/extraction step is no
longer a speculative route; its exact reduction and arithmetic are
written above. No universal all-varieties Hodge theorem follows.


## GPT-6 branch transfer and native proof assembly

Transferred from `mathbox/residual-zero-direct-audit-20261015` at
`94f9f20c4cb73ad37821d324125b4b81e3176318` onto
`research/gpt6-native-point-primitive-span-20261017`, based on
`48955f6be6b61a3dd61c6dded65957855a42e768`.
The extraction arithmetic module and Wolfram evidence are unchanged.
The native assembly extends the existing
`GSTUniversalCMArithmeticObstruction.lean`, preserving its obstruction
theorems and the GPT-6 branch's earlier CM/QM work.

For target coordinates \((a,(u,v))\), write
\(z=\operatorname{contractGraph}(M)=(x,y)\),
\(w=(d+1+u_K)^*z=(r x-d s y,s x+r y)\), where \(u_K^2=-d\).
Set \(D=xw_2-yw_1=s(x^2+dy^2)>0\). The constructed coefficients are
\[
 c=\frac{u w_2-v w_1}{D},\qquad e=\frac{xv-yu}{D}.
\]
The native output on the original fourfold is exactly
\[
 Z_\alpha=a\,\Theta^2+c\,\operatorname{extract}(\Gamma)
                  +e\,\operatorname{cmPullback}(\operatorname{extract}(\Gamma)).
\]
`weilPlaneCramerReconstruction` proves both coordinate equalities.
`auxiliaryWeilNativeCycle` defines this actual rational native cycle;
`auxiliaryWeilNativeCycle_class` proves equality in the supplied rational
Hodge fiber; `auxiliaryWeilEveryMiddleHodgeClass` proves
`H.cycleClass 2 Z = alpha` in the original supplied Betti cohomology.
The determinant is derived from tensor balance and nonvanishing, not
assumed. No source is selected as a function of alpha. This also avoids
misapplying the earlier Q(i) companion formula to a general quadratic K.

### Exact formal inputs and interpretation

| Input | Mathematical instantiation | Lean status in this assembly |
|---|---|---|
| One fixed native codimension-three source Γ | T6 on the padded split sixfold, pure nonzero Weil class | Explicit theorem parameter; T6 is external |
| Native extraction linear map | Intersect with the genuine diagonal difference, then proper pushforward | Explicit map; geometric construction is in this manuscript |
| Balanced nonzero tensor M | K-determinant sector of the source's canonical class | Explicit two balance equations and nonzero condition |
| Native CM pullback | Rationally normalized integral isogeny pullback for d+1+u_K | Explicit native endomorphism |
| Hodge coordinates | Generic decomposition Q·theta² ⊕ W_K(A), not algebraic-cycle spanning | Explicit linear equivalence |
| Three fixed class identities | Polarization, extraction naturality, degree-four CM character | Explicit equalities; independent of the prescribed target |
| H and G | Actual Betti/Hodge data and geometric cycle-class spine | Existing interfaces; canonical geometric instantiation remains required |

The theorem computes a preimage for every target only **after** these
fixed geometric inputs. It does not quantify over geometrically
constructed Weil fourfolds or formalize their dimension, K-action,
canonical analytification, T6 or Chow intersection. The stronger paper
claim follows using the stated external geometry; the Lean result is
its explicit conditional native-cycle assembly. No all-varieties Hodge
claim is made. The completed GitHub integration receipt follows.

The first integration attempt, `39067876668`, failed at two final
coordinate equalities because a restricted simplifier left nested product
scalar actions unreduced. Commit `b38695e` repairs precisely those two
proof lines with scalar-action simplification; no theorem statements,
source hypotheses or cycle formula changed. The universal Cramer identity
already compiled in the first attempt. Only the successful final run is
the verification receipt for the assembled native theorem.

**Completion scope:** the transfer and conditional native-cycle proof
assembly are finished on the GPT-6 branch. T6, the geometric source-to-tensor
dictionary, extraction/CM comparison, the generic Hodge decomposition and
the canonical Betti realization remain the explicit external geometric
inputs listed above. CI does not certify that these inputs have been
constructed in Lean, and does not establish the all-varieties Hodge theorem.
