# GST connected curvature native chain -> every rational channel cycle

This file proves that a CONNECTED SEQUENCE OF GENUINE NATIVE
OPERATORS, started from ONE already algebraic seed, constructs a
full rational Betti basis and every prescribed target, and compiles
it to ONE cyclic native endomorphism via the PREEXISTING GST finite
cyclic-completion constructor.

The input does NOT include target cycles, a Hodge-to-Chow inverse,
a full-rank source frame, or surjectivity of the cycle-class map.
It contains ONE seed cycle, and the geometric edge-operator laws
which will be instantiated by the rational GST spectral projector
and noncommutative curvature words derived in the companion TeX file.

The general rational chain theorem is proved in Lean under the
actual-edge hypotheses. Proving the geometry of those edge operators
on EVERY original smooth projective complex X remains the active
universal GST source-birth task; the abstract shape calculus alone
does not install the canonical whole-Betti realization.
