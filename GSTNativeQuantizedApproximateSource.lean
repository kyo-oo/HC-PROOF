# Exact rational-lattice quantization of approximate GST native Betti sources

Geometry (independently proved in the companion derivation):
research/derivations/GST_20261112_approximate_native_Hodge_source_quantized_lattice_return.tex

For any original X, rational prescribed alpha with d*alpha integral,
and a ACTUAL algebraic cycle beta with m*beta integral, m<=C,
a canonical Betti class within the STRICT rational-integral lattice
threshold 1/(d*C) of alpha MUST BE EXACTLY alpha.
This reduces the geometric GST input from exact target matching
to bounded-degree ACTUAL Chow cycles with approximate Betti targets.
It does not construct those cycles or their degree bound by fiat.

This file formalizes the ARITHMETIC CORE over Q, usable
coordinatewise on the free integral cohomology lattice of X.
