# GST WORLD CROWN BRIDGE — old twelve-cell cups absorbed by native transport

This layer proves that the original twelve-cell cup operators are not
independent laws.  Under the exact chart equivalence of
`GSTWorldCosmology`, they are the one-step native axis transports.

Consequently commutation and the 3/4 boundary nilpotence are inherited
from the dimension-free world laws.
