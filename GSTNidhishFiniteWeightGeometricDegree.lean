# Nidhish GST finite-weight geometric degree conservation law

This is a VALID replacement for an unlimited unweighted native-mass
bridge. Actual smooth projective varieties have finite dimension.
Codimension-p algebraic cycles vanish for p above that dimension, so
a universally nonzero algebraic spine for ALL p cannot be correct.

Define a projective-geometric DEGREE charge only on a certified
finite codimension range 0<=p<=d. Require:
1. a genuine native rational linear degree at each weight;
2. an ambient rational cohomological degree readout;
3. compatibility of the two through ACTUAL cycle-class maps;
4. nonzero degree of the canonical codimension-zero fundamental cycle;
5. the projective principal-cut successor degree transport for p<d.

Unlike unweighted coefficient-count mass, a cohomology-compatible
intersection/degree charge is allowed to annihilate homologically
trivial cycles. There is NO assertion of nonzero cycles for p>d.

The theorem derives conservation and nonzero genuine algebraic
Hodge spine classes at EACH p<=d. This constructs a consistent
finite-window geometric source law, without ANY assertion that
its structural hypotheses have been proved for all varieties.
The independent verification of the geometric degree fields is a
substantive next obligation (cup/Gysin/projective intersection).
