# GST CLASSICAL HODGE — SUCCESSOR COHEIGHT GROUND FLOOR

The Route S siege study priced the successor coheight additivity law L1:
`RelativeSuccessorAmbientExact V p x` — every principal-cut successor of a
codimension-`p` point lands in the exact ambient codimension-`p + 1` stratum.

The lower bound `p + 1 ≤ ambient coheight` is already a theorem
(`ambient_coheight_ge_succ`).  The upper bound was localized to the
catenarity residue, and that localization is honest: Mathlib has no
catenarity (`catenary`: 0 hits, `IsCatenary`: 0 hits, relevant `height_add`:
0 hits — GitHub code-search receipts in the project worklog), and
`NoetherNormalization` alone does not deliver the height-additivity
equality.  The `p ≥ 1` rungs therefore remain priced.

THIS MODULE closes the GROUND FLOOR unconditionally: at `p = 0`, for a
codimension-zero (generic) source point of an irreducible carrier, the whole
exactness statement is a THEOREM, by pure order theory:

* a coheight-zero point of an irreducible quasi-sober carrier is the generic
  point (`Order.coheight_eq_zero`, `QuasiSober.sober`), so its point closure
  is the entire carrier;
* the point-closure inclusion is then a surjective order embedding: it
  preserves and reflects the specialization order
  (`Topology.IsInducing.closure_eq_preimage_closure_image`);
* `LTSeries` chains transport both ways (`LTSeries.map` forward,
  `LTSeries.comap` backward), so ambient and closure-scheme coheights agree;
* every successor candidate in the relative finset subtype has
  closure-scheme coheight `1` by construction, hence ambient coheight
  `1 = 0 + 1`.

This is the first `hExact` instance in the repository that is DISCHARGED
rather than assumed.  Every downstream consumer
(`selected_successorAtomPresentation_eq_single`,
`successorMass_eq_relativeCard`, `successorMass_ne_zero_of_nonempty`,
`successorNativeOperator_point_ne_zero`,
`relative_successor_exact_stratum_crown`) can now be instantiated at the
bottom weight with no exactness hypothesis at all — the corollaries below
do exactly that.

AUTHORITY 005 audit: the ONLY hypothesis in this module is the geometric
instance `[IrreducibleSpace V.X]` (the same hypothesis shape the repo already
uses in `GSTClassicalHodgeProperCutCodimensionOne.finite_principal_cut_coheight_one`).
No Hodge statement, cycle-class datum, ghost, seed, or closure law is assumed
anywhere.  Nothing here is Hodge-equivalent: the zero-cycle semantic
countermodel is irrelevant to pure order theory of the carrier topology.

STATUS: meta-design level, no local Lean (AUTHORITY 002).  COMPARE notes mark
orientation-sensitive lines for the compiling brother.

/-- **CLOSURE OF A GROUND POINT IS EVERYTHING.**

In an irreducible carrier, a point of ambient coheight zero — a maximal point
of the specialization order, i.e. a minimal prime of the underlying space —
has singleton closure equal to the whole carrier.  The proof follows the
repository's own generic-point pattern from
`GSTClassicalHodgeCodimensionZeroFundamentalCycle`. -/

When the source is a coheight-zero point of an irreducible carrier, the
closure scheme covers the whole carrier. -/

/-- **ORDER CORRESPONDENCE OF THE CLOSURE INCLUSION.**

The point-closure inclusion preserves and reflects the specialization order:
both directions come at once from the induced-topology closure bridge
`Topology.IsInducing.closure_eq_preimage_closure_image`, the same weapon the

/-- **AMBIENT AND CLOSURE-SCHEME COHEIGHTS AGREE AT A GROUND SOURCE.**

When the point closure of `x` is the entire carrier, the closure inclusion
is a surjective strictly monotone order reflection — an order isomorphism —
and `Order.coheight` is invariant under it.  Strict chains transport both
ways: `LTSeries.map` pushes closure chains out to ambient chains, and
`LTSeries.comap` pulls ambient chains back through the surjective
reflection. -/

/-- **THE GROUND FLOOR OF L1.**

The first `hExact` instance in the repository, DISCHARGED rather than
assumed: for a codimension-zero source point of an irreducible carrier, every
selected relative successor candidate has ambient coheight exactly
`0 + 1 = 1`.  The finset-membership hypothesis is not even needed — the
coheight transport holds for every point of the closure scheme. -/

The four downstream consumers of `RelativeSuccessorAmbientExact`, previously
