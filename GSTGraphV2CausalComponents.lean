# GST Graph V2 — causal components and dimension-independent worlds

A General Space need not be acyclic.  Two distinct states can have
oppositely directed causal histories without creating a contradiction in
classical logic.  Their *causal component* records mutual reachability.

Mutual reachability is an equivalence relation.  The quotient has a
canonical antisymmetric reachability order, even if the original cosmos
contains feedback loops.  Genuine GST event-preserving folds induce
well-defined, reachability-monotone maps on these components.

This makes an exact, coordinate-free distinction between:
* reversible causal feedback **inside** a component;
* genuine directional causal growth **between** components.

An independent infinite successor example shows that no finite horizon
or maximum dimension is imposed by the core ontology.  The example is a
realization, not an assertion that every GST graph is infinite.
