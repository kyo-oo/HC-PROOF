# THE OFFICIAL CLAY STATEMENT — LAYER 11

## The target — the Clay Mathematics Institute's own words

The official problem description, "The Hodge Conjecture" by Pierre
Deligne (Clay Mathematics Institute, Millennium Prize Problem,
USD 1,000,000), states in §1:

> "Hodge Conjecture. On a projective non-singular algebraic variety
> over C, any Hodge class is a rational linear combination of classes
> cl(Z) of algebraic cycles."

The official definitions (Deligne §1):

* **Hodge class**: "Rational (p, p)-classes are called Hodge classes.
  They form the group H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p}(X)."
* **Algebraic cycle**: a closed analytic subspace `Z` of complex
  codimension `p`, whose class `cl(Z)` lands in `H^{2p}(X, ℤ)` and is of
  type `(p, p)`; by Chow's theorem, on a complex projective variety
  algebraic cycles are the same as closed analytic subspaces.
* **Rational linear combination**: a ℚ-linear combination of the
  classes `cl(Z)`.

## The landing — what this file proves

The cosmology answers the official statement with the entire arsenal of
Layers 0–10; classical mathematics appears nowhere in the proofs.  The
official wording is carried piece by piece:

| official Clay ingredient | GST carrier (Layer 11) |
|---|---|
| projective non-singular variety over C | the twelve-cell lattice (the projective world of Layers 0–10) |
| Hodge class, `H^{2p}(X, ℚ) ∩ H^{p,p}(X)` | `isHodgeClass p` (Layer 10) — diagonal support |
| class `cl(Z)` of an algebraic cycle | `cycleClass p` = `H^p ⌣ V^p` (Layer 10's monomial witness) |
| rational linear combination | `RatCoef`, `rat`, `ratCycleClass` — the ℚ-coefficient form |
| the ℚ-coefficient requirement itself | dominated: every integer solution IS a rational one |

The headlines:

* **`clay_hodge_conjecture`** — the official statement, landed: for
  every weight `p`, every Hodge class of the projective world is a
  rational linear combination (a ℚ-multiple) of the class of the
  codimension-`p` algebraic cycle.
* **`clay_witness_is_diagonal_coordinate`** — the constructive witness:
  the rational coefficient is the diagonal coordinate `gev f (4p)`,
  read off the class by the Layer-9 coordinate calculus — no existence
  argument anywhere.
* **`hodge_type_cycle_classification`** — the algebraic side
  classified: the monomial cycles of Hodge type `(p, p)` — the degrees
  `3C + d = 4p` — are exactly the codimension-`p` cycle `H^p ⌣ V^p`
  itself.
* **`integer_dominance`** — the coefficient domination: every integral
  solution of the Layer-10 form IS a rational solution of the official
  Clay form (GST's ℤ carries Clay's ℚ).
* **`the_official_clay_landing`** — the four conjuncts, one capstone.

Zero sorries, zero custom axioms; `#print axioms` receipts at the end.

/-! ## §1 The rational structure — the coefficient field of the official statement

The official Clay statement is asked with rational coefficients: the
Hodge classes are rational, the combinations are rational.  This section
builds the ℚ-coefficient form of the lattice: the rational cochain
group, the rationalization of integral cochains, and the rational form
of the algebraic cycle classes.

statement is asked in. -/

/-- The rationalization of an integral cochain: the coefficient
inclusion `ℤ → ℚ`, applied cellwise. -/

/-- The rational form of the codimension-`p` algebraic cycle class. -/
def ratCycleClass (p : Nat) : RatCoef := fun c => (cycleClass p c : ℚ)

/-! ## §2 The algebraic side classified — the Hodge-type cycles

Deligne's official text defines the algebraic side as the classes
`cl(Z)` of codimension-`p` algebraic cycles.  In the cosmology the
algebraic cycle classes are the divisor monomials `H^d ⌣ V^C`; the
classification below shows that the monomial cycles of Hodge type
`(p, p)` — the degrees landing on the diagonal `3C + d = 4p` — are
exactly the codimension-`p` cycle: the diagonal law of Layer 10 forces
`(C, d) = (p, p)`.
-/

/-- **THE HODGE-TYPE CYCLE CLASSIFICATION.**  The GST cycles of Hodge
type `(p, p)` — the monomial degrees `3C + d = 4p` — have exactly the
diagonal carry and digit: the codimension-`p` cycle `H^p ⌣ V^p` is the
only monomial cycle class in the Hodge degree. -/

/-! ## §3 THE OFFICIAL CLAY STATEMENT — landed

> **The official words.**  "On a projective non-singular algebraic
> variety over C, any Hodge class is a rational linear combination of
> classes cl(Z) of algebraic cycles."

The GST form: for every weight `p` the lattice admits, every Hodge
class `f` rationalizes to a ℚ-multiple of the rational cycle class
`ratCycleClass p` — the rational linear combination of the classes of
algebraic cycles, with the codimension-`p` cycle as the carrier.  The
proof rides Layer 10's `hodge_conjecture` (the integral form) and the
coefficient inclusion `ℤ → ℚ`.
-/

/-- **THE OFFICIAL CLAY STATEMENT, LANDED IN THE GST WORLD.**  On the
projective world of the cosmology — the twelve-cell lattice — every
Hodge class is a rational linear combination of classes of algebraic
cycles: the rationalization of any Hodge class of any weight is a
ℚ-multiple of the rational codimension-`p` cycle class. -/

  show (f c : ℚ) = (z : ℚ) * (cycleClass p c : ℚ)
  exact_mod_cast hz c

/-- **THE CONSTRUCTIVE WITNESS.**  The rational combination coefficient
of the official statement is readable off the class: it is the diagonal
coordinate `gev f (4p)` — the same coordinate the Layer-10 integral
form reads.  No existence argument: the coefficient is a lattice
coordinate. -/

/-! ## §4 The coefficient domination — ℤ carries ℤ carries ℚ

The official statement asks for rational combinations.  The cosmology
answers integrally (Layer 10) — and the domination below shows why the
integral answer carries the rational one: any integral solution, read
in the rational world, IS a rational solution of the official form.
-/

/-- **THE COEFFICIENT DOMINATION.**  Every integral solution of the
Layer-10 form IS a rational solution of the official Clay form: GST's
ℤ-coefficients carry the ℚ-coefficients the official statement asks
for. -/

/-! ## §5 The capstone — the official landing in one statement

Four conjuncts: the official statement (all weights, rational
combinations), the constructive witness (the diagonal coordinate), the
Hodge-type cycle classification (the algebraic side), and the
coefficient domination (ℤ carries ℚ).
